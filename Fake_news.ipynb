      "house dem aide: we didn’t even see comey’s letter until jason chaffetz tweeted it darrell lucushouse dem aide: we didn’t even see comey’s letter until jason chaffetz tweeted it by darrell lucus on october 30, 2016 subscribe jason chaffetz on the stump in american fork, utah ( image courtesy michael jolley, available under a creative commons-by license) with apologies to keith olbermann, there is no doubt who the worst person in the world is this week–fbi director james comey. but according to a house democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. it turns out that when comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the fbi was looking into emails that may be related to hillary clinton’s email server, the ranking democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from comey. they found out via a tweet from one of the republican committee chairmen. as we now know, comey notified the republican chairmen and democratic ranking members of the house intelligence, judiciary, and oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. not long after this letter went out, oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. fbi dir just informed me, \"the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" case reopened — jason chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) october 28, 2016 of course, we now know that this was not the case . comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be anthony weiner’s sexting with a teenager. but apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to chaffetz. the utah republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. apparently chaffetz thought the fbi was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. but according to a senior house democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of chaffetz’ sins. that aide told shareblue that his boss and other democrats didn’t even know about comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked twitter. “democratic ranking members on the relevant committees didn’t receive comey’s letter until after the republican chairmen. in fact, the democratic ranking members didn’ receive it until after the chairman of the oversight and government reform committee, jason chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” so let’s see if we’ve got this right. the fbi director tells chaffetz and other gop committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their democratic counterparts know about it. instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on twitter. there has already been talk on daily kos that comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to chaffetz and other republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. that may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. after all, there is nothing so far that suggests that comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. what it does suggest, however, is that chaffetz is acting in a way that makes dan burton and darrell issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. he didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member elijah cummings about something this explosive. if that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, i don’t know what does. granted, it’s not likely that chaffetz will have to answer for this. he sits in a ridiculously republican district anchored in provo and orem; it has a cook partisan voting index of r+25, and gave mitt romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. moreover, the republican house leadership has given its full support to chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. but that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. after all, he is a textbook example of what the house has become under republican control. and he is also the second worst person in the world. about darrell lucus darrell is a 30-something graduate of the university of north carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school. an attempt to turn him into a member of the religious right in college only succeeded in turning him into the religious right's worst nightmare--a charismatic christian who is an unapologetic liberal. his desire to stand up for those who have been scared into silence only increased when he survived an abusive three-year marriage. you may know him on daily kos as christian dem in nc . follow him on twitter @darrelllucus or connect with him on facebook . click here to buy darrell a mello yello. connect why the truth might get you fired consortiumnews.comwhy the truth might get you fired october 29, 2016 the tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the iraq war, writes lawrence davidson. by lawrence davidson for those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. the action here plays out in the united states, but the lessons are probably universal. back in the early spring of 2003, george w. bush initiated the invasion of iraq. one of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country’s dictator, saddam hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. the real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the middle east. president george w. bush and vice president dick cheney receive an oval office briefing from cia director george tenet. also present is chief of staff andy card (on right). (white house photo) for our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. why did president bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? the short answer is bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading iraq. at first he had tried to connect saddam hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the u.s. though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an american people, already fixated on afghanistan, to support a war against baghdad. but the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-saddam iraqis (many on the u.s. government’s payroll ), kept telling bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. what we had was a u.s. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. the strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear iraq lowered the threshold for proof . likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide u.s. campaign generating both fear and war fever. so the u.s. and its allies insisted that the united nations send in weapons inspectors to scour iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). that the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the bush administration and soon forced its hand. on march 19, 2003, bush launched the invasion of iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, u.s. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). they did not. their iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. social and behavioral sciences to the rescue? the various u.s. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out – specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” to that end the cia et al. are in the market for academic assistance. ahmed chalabi, head of the iraqi national congress, a key supplier of iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden wmd. a “partnership” is being forged between the office of the director of national intelligence (odni), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent u.s. intelligence agencies, and the national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine . the result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent intelligence community studies board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” despite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want – a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. but even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. it is to be found with the believers. the believers it is simply not true, as the odni leaders seem to assert, that u.s. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. this is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth – that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like afghanistan, iraq, syria, libya, israel, palestine and elsewhere. director of national intelligence james clapper (right) talks with president barack obama in the oval office, with john brennan and other national security aides present. (photo credit: office of director of national intelligence) therefore, if someone feeds them “snake oil,” they usually know it. however, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors – those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview – have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. listen to charles gaukel, of the national intelligence council – yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, gaukel has declared, “ we’re looking for truth. but we’re particularly looking for truth that works. ” now what might that mean? i can certainly tell you what it means historically. it means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview – their political and ideological precepts. if it does not fit, it does not “work.” so the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. on the other hand, as long as what you’re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary iraqi nukes, israel as a western-style democracy, saudi arabia as an indispensable ally, libya as a liberated country, bashar al-assad as the real roadblock to peace in syria, the strategic defense initiative (sdi) aka star wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, american exceptionalism in all its glory – the list is almost endless. what does this sad tale tell us? if you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. what you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers – the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class – presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. it has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of shakespeare’s determination that “what is past, is prelude.” our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will – no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. hope springs eternal. 15 civilians killed in single us airstrike have been identified jessica purkissvideos 15 civilians killed in single us airstrike have been identified the rate at which civilians are being killed by american airstrikes in afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the us was engaged in active combat operations. photo of hellfire missiles being loaded onto a us military reaper drone in afghanistan by staff sgt. brian ferguson/u.s. air force. the bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single us drone strike in afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the medecins sans frontieres hospital (msf) last october. the us claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against islamic state (is) fighters when it hit nangarhar province with missiles on september 28. but the next day the united nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to mecca. the bureau spoke to a man named haji rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. he said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). the bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. rais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. another man, abdul hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. rais said he had no involvement with is and denied us claims that is members had visited his house before the strike. he said: “i did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” the deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single american strike in afghanistan since the attack on the msf hospital in kunduz last october, which killed at least 42 people. the nangarhar strike was not the only us attack to kill civilians in september. the bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four american strikes in afghanistan and somalia that month. on september 18 a pair of strikes killed eight afghan policemen in tarinkot, the capital of urozgan provice. us jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. the use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. the us told the bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to afghan forces. the email did not directly address the allegations of afghan policemen being killed. at the end of the month in somalia, citizens burnt us flags on the streets of the north-central city of galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 somali soldiers and civilians. the strike occurred on the same day as the one in nangarhar. in both the somali and afghan incidents, the us at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. it is now investigating both the strikes in nangarhar and galcayo. the rate at which civilians are being killed by american airstrikes in afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the us was engaged in active combat operations. name iranian woman jailed for fictional unpublished story about woman stoned to death for adultery howard portnoyprint an iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after iran’s revolutionary guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she’d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the eurasia review . golrokh ebrahimi iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner arash sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. “when the intelligence unit of the revolutionary guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment – without a warrant – and found drafts of stories that ebrahimi iraee had written,” the article stated. “one of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery – never published, never presented to anyone,” the article stated. “the narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under islamic law for adultery. life: life of luxury: elton john’s 6 favorite shark pictures to stare at during long, transcontinental flights ever wonder how britain’s most iconic pop pianist gets through a long flight? here are the six pictures of sharks sir elton john likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane. 1. a shark swimming sit next to elton john on a flight and you’ll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. the platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animal’s triumphant return. he will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. a great white shark leaping into the air when you’re an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in elton john’s seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. the five-time grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the shark’s beady eyes. 3. a shark on the prowl rumor has it elton john first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to london to perform “candle in the wind” at princess diana’s funeral. it’s been a staple of his travel routine ever since. those who have flown with the music legend say that sir elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. two hammerhead sharks how does the man behind “tiny dancer” and “rocket man” handle turbulence as his plane traverses the atlantic? once that “fasten seat belts” sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. elton john holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. the poster for jaws sir elton john absolutely adores the poster for steven spielberg’s jaws and hopes to one day see the film. in the meantime, the british icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever he’s on a long flight, gently tracing the shark’s teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. pilot’s choice as much as elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from london to a distant corner of europe. that’s why all pilots who fly sir elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff. so yeah—it’s good to be elton! russian researchers discover secret nazi military base ‘treasure hunter’ in the arctic [photos] amando flaviothe mystery surrounding the third reich and nazi germany is still a subject of debate between many observers. some believe that nazi germany, under the control of adolf hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. however, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with nazi germany. nazi germany invaded russia (formerly the ussr) during the second world war on june 22, 1941. at the time, the german army progressed deep into russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital moscow, before the russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the nazis back. during the nazi occupation in russia, in 1942, the nazis built a secret military base around the arctic, code-named “schatzgraber” or “treasure hunter,” which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against russia. the base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of nazi troops, warships and submarines. the base also housed eminent nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a german win of the war. it was widely speculated at the time that the nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. the controversial ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. the ahnenerbe was an institute in nazi germany. responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. founded on july 1, 1935, by heinrich himmler, herman wirth and richard walther darré, the ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological nordic populations had once ruled the world. however, the nazis abandoned the base in 1944 – a time when the russian army began its offensive, pushing the germans out of the country. according to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. this caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a german u-boat. despite russian authors telling the story of “treasure hunter,” some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence. but russian researchers have now announced that “treasure hunter” has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of alexandra land in the arctic circle, located 620 miles from the north pole. a senior researcher at the russian arctic national park, evgeny ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : “before it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.” us officials see no link between trump and russia jason ditzclinton campaign demands fbi affirm trump's russia ties with the 2016 election campaign winding down, the clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the fbi to publicly confirm the campaign’s allegations that republican nominee donald trump is secretly in league with russia. sen. harry reid (d – nv) went so far as to claim the fbi has secret “explosive” evidence of coordination between the trump campaign and the russian government that it is withholding. fbi officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the clinton campaign started publicizing around the democratic national convention, say they’ve turned up nothing to connect trump and russia , leading fbi director james comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. the clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming “everyone knows” that they are true, and appears unsettled by the fbi’s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven’t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. the trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to russia, but that didn’t stop clinton from calling trump a “puppet” of russian president vladimir putin during the final presidential debate. the calls have grown since friday’s fbi report to congress about further clinton emails being sought. with clinton’s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming trump as secretly in league with the russians would only be fair. absent any evidence, however, it appears that won’t be happening. re: yes, there are paid government trolls on social media, blogs, forums and websites anotherannieyes, there are paid government trolls on social media, blogs, forums and websites february 26th, 2014 do you want solid proof that paid government shills are targeting websites, blogs, forums and social media accounts? for years, many have suspected that government trolls have been systematically causing havoc all over the internet, but proving it has been difficult. but now thanks to documents leaked by edward snowden and revealed by glenn greenwald, we finally have hard evidence that western governments have been doing this. as you will see below, a uk intelligence outfit known as the government communications headquarters, through a previously secret unit known as the joint threat research intelligence group, has been systematically attempting “to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse”. this should be deeply disturbing to anyone that values free speech on the internet. it isn’t just that the british government is trying to influence what people are thinking. the reality is that this is far bigger than a mere propaganda campaign. as greenwald recently noted on his new website , the “integrity of the internet itself” is at stake… by publishing these stories one by one, our nbc reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of youtube and blogger , the targeting of anonymous with the very same ddos attacks they accuse “hacktivists” of using, the use of “ honey traps ” (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses . but, here, i want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse , and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself. so what techniques are the british using to control and manipulate discourse on the internet? according to greenwald, the documents that snowden has uncovered show that they are willing to sink to despicable lows in order to get the results that they desire… among the core self-identified purposes of jtrig are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. to see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “ false flag operations ” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “ negative information ” on various forums. the following is a list of internet infiltration techniques that were listed on one particular slide that snowden leaked… – infiltration operation – sting operation you can check out this slide for yourself right here . there is also evidence that the canadian government has been involved in this sort of thing as well. natural news … you’ve probably run into them before — those seemingly random antagonizers who always end up diverting the conversation in an online chat room or article comment section away from the issue at hand, and towards a much different agenda. hot-button issues like illegal immigration, the two-party political system, the “war on terror” and even alternative medicine are among the most common targets of such attackers, known as internet “trolls” or “shills,” who in many cases are nothing more than paid lackeys hired by the federal government and other international organizations to sway and ultimately control public opinion . several years ago, canada’s ctv news aired a short segment about how its own government had been exposed for hiring secret agents to monitor social media and track online conversations, as well as the activities of certain dissenting individuals. this report, which in obvious whitewashing language referred to such activities as the government simply “ weighing in and correcting ” allegedly false information posted online, basically admitted that the canadian government had assumed the role of secret online police . you can see a video news report about this activity up in canada right here . are you disturbed yet? you should be. so what kind of people are the governments of the western world targeting online? well, when it comes to the u.s. government, all you have to do is to look at their official documents to see who they consider the “problems” to be. for much more on this, please see my previous article entitled “ 72 types of americans that are considered ‘potential terrorists’ in official government documents “. sadly, the reality of the matter is that the days of the free and open internet are numbered. the governments of the world are increasing their control over the internet with each passing day, and eventually a time will likely come when we will not be able to communicate openly like this any longer. things have gotten so bad in the u.s. already that even google is spooked … a recent court decision that endorsed a broad view of the federal communications commission’s authority over the internet has google and other web companies nervous. in closed-door meetings with regulators and capitol hill staff, google’s lawyers have said they’re worried how the fcc may use its newfound powers, according to multiple people familiar with the meetings. the extent of the fcc’s authority over google and other web services remains unclear, and the current fcc has given no indication that it is interested in pushing aggressive new regulations. but the possibility that the commission could begin telling google how to organize its search results or handle its users’ data is enough to spook the company’s army of washington lobbyists. and this is just the beginning. if you think that the control freaks that are running things now are bad, just wait until you see the next generation of control freaks. for example, there is one prominent student writer at harvard that apparently believes that free speech at her university should be abolished and that any professor that does not advocate for her politically-correct version of “justice” should be fired … a student writer at harvard university is raising eyebrows after publishing her belief that free speech on campus should be abolished and professors with opposing views be fired. sandra korn, a senior who writes a column for the harvard crimson newspaper, thinks radical leftism is the only permissible political philosophy, and the first amendment only hinders colleges from brainwashing students with her viewpoint. “let’s give up on academic freedom in favor of justice,” states the subtitle of her feb. 18 column , in which she insists harvard stop guaranteeing students and professors the right to hold controversial views and conduct research putting liberalism in a negative light. “if our university community opposes racism, sexism, and heterosexism, why should we put up with research that counters our goals?” korn asks. this is what control freaks always want. they always want to shut down those that are presenting opposing views. they don’t believe in free speech and a “marketplace of ideas”. rather, they believe in shoving what they believe down the rest of our throats. and now we have solid proof that the governments of the western world are paying people to manipulate discourse on social media, blogs, forums and websites. so will there be great outrage over this, or will the apathetic public just roll over and ignore this like they have so many other times the past few years? my guess, most will just roll over and ignore this. people don’t care. hammerstrike at least i know why people disagree with me other dem intrenets now, they are paid trolls! paid by the governement to spread falsehoods and hurt muh feelins! seth datta most of my comments get deleted by bankster paid control freaks if they don’t troll my comments. banksters truly are the psychopaths destroying the world. k the amazing thing is, they are not that hard to spot. but since like so many other things, people will not face the truth. this information will only help a very few. for those of you still sitting on the fence. how much more evidence do you need? how many more ways does the government have to mess with you? what will it finally take, to say enough? rodster “don’t confuse me with the facts. i already made up my mind.” supernaturalcat “the amazing thing is, they are not that hard to spot. but since like so many other things, people will not face the truth.” indeed. never underestimate the power of denial. djohn1 this is called doing anything for a paycheck. otherwise known in the world as prostituting for money. snowden probably has a few other “surprises” in the material he has not released yet. this also dates back to way before the internet was ever thought of. pr firms for the government have been making fun of anything that they truly want to hide. such as any legitimate ufo reporting over the last 50 or so years. anyone with a thorough knowledge of solar system astronomy was made to feel like a nut as far back as the 50s. one russian scientist came up with a fantastic theory of how venus came to be where it is in the solar system. in 1949 or 1950 scientists all over the planet wanted his books banned from publication and actually boycotted anyone that would pub his work. his theory said that venus was extremely hot(800 degrees fahrenheit). that the planet had a weird rotation. that it possibly came into the solar system around the time of joseph of egypt and 400 years later caused the plagues of egypt under moses. that placed it in biblical times. well venus does have a weird day. it is longer than its year. venus is full of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. it has an atmosphere much thicker than the earth’s. all of which sort of lend credit to the theory. it is volcanic and has a very hot surface. in 1950, astronomers were guessing that venus was a twin to earth with a slightly higher temperature. possibly 150 at the equator and comfortable at the poles. then the russian drones sent to venus told an entirely different story and blew all of the astronomers out of the water. i hope i am embarrassing them for their efforts to ban the man from publication. he spent his years at princeton university after leaving russia. two aspects of the theory should make us all sit up and listen. he claimed the hydrocarbons rained oil over the surface of the earth and that might be where a lot of earth’s supply of oil came from. the russians are acting on that theory to find new oil reserves. the second aspect is that venus played a kind of bounce game as it came down through the solar system and removed the second planet from the sun in the process and dumped it out further in the solar system. he thought that mars was originally in the orbit where venus is today. his theory was that mankind forgot what happened in a kind of national amnesia. if what he says was true, then mars could have had a thick enough atmosphere and water to support life! more important it might have had a thick magnetic layer that filtered out the sun and kept the planet temperate at one time. all of which was ruined as venus dragged it out of orbit. that might have happened in biblical times. the earth might have been slightly closer to the sun with a 360 day year instead of 365 and a quarter day year. this of course is all speculation until we go out there and find out the real truth of what is going on. my own guess is that if there is life on mars it is in caves under the surface with a slightly heavier atmosphere and possibly seas in these huge caverns. if there is any surface life left, it is likely to be about the size of a dog or a racoon. if there is large life, i suspect it will be sand worms deep in the sands of mars. i mention this because it is very easy to ridicule ideas. the one i just told you about actually happened in the 50s and was ridiculed coast to coast by actual scientists. we are in a universe with over 100 billion galaxies out there. the number of stars with life possible is at a fantastic number. if one in a million stars has life, that is still a whole lot of life out there. the only explanation that makes sense to me is we are far off the trade lanes between the stars. otherwise we would have been contacted years ago. or have we been? i suggest that when a civilization reaches the level of using atomic bombs then that civilization bares watching. we had a lot of ufo activity after world war ii and the setting off of bombs all over the planet as governments tested these weapons. governments all over the world that are big enough are probably hiding a lot of things from all of us. i think we might all be amazed at just exactly what has been withheld. nowalive this is quite a postulation on the mere evidence that was correct, namely the temperature of venus. the plagues of egypt were localized. you had firstborns killed unless you used a passover lamb. second, what about the oils raining down all over the earth? i was quite young when valdez crashed. the oil rig explosion in the gulf is more recent. the hydrocarbon dumping would have killed off most life on the planet. basically my point is that observational science shows that virtually none of what you just stated has been proven or even has any legitimate evidence. it’s wild speculation. i’m not an astrophysicist, but i doubt you are either. the governments hiding things is obvious. this in no way shows life on mars or venus dumping oil or switching orbital positions. it does not even slightly point to alien visitations or life. i’m not trying to offend you. i’m just trying to understand what you just said in a way that shows there is some evidence for it. djohn1 you are quite right. it is wild speculation on my part. except the temperature is not the only evidence. venus rotates the wrong direction in its spin or day. it is the only planet in the entire solar system to do so. the day is 268 of our days long. the year is 222 of our days. that the temperatures are so high could just be the closeness to the sun. the atmosphere is 15 times thicker than our planet’s atmosphere. that speaks to me that something unusual is going on. as for the oil, it is showing up in places that only a rain of oil might explain. the critical thing that we do not know is when it occurred or if it occurred at all. if i am right, there is a good possibility that the moon will have some fairly large deposits of oil under the surface. there is a lot of unexplained discoloration on face of the moon. if there is oil under the surface of the moon, it might also mean that the moon was a small planet at one time with an atmosphere and life. again, i am speculating. the theory did not come from astrophysics. it came from examining a lot of stories all over the planet from the approximate time of moses. that was velinkovsky’s specialty, ancient languages and psychology of ancient cultures. rastus a field of study that you may or may not have heard of is called “catastrophism”. not without its critics and highly controversial among biblical scholars, you may find the subject a good scratch to your itch. a book by donald wesley patten called “catastrophism and the old testament” might be in accordance with your fancy. johnny are you speaking of immanuel velikovsky? he is the author of worlds in collision. he points out the chaos of the universe. i found him interesting to read in 1958. djohn1 yes. he was not a specialist in astronomy. he simply pointed out what the beliefs of the ancient world were. he did upset the scientific world of his time. i think he was at least 50% right about things. we now know that venus could not have come from jupiter or saturn. my own thought is that it had to come from the outer solar system or beyond. we have well over 100 moons around the planets. most of which are around the gas giants. most of which have a nickel/iron core. none of which could have come from the major gas giants in the solar system. they had to come from something much more dense and much older. the man most likely to shake the core beliefs of astrophysics and astronomy is an accomplished astronomer, dr. mike brown. what he is finding is there are a series of small, pluto sized planets, some with small moons in the outer solar system. scientists have been looking in the wrong place. of the four new planets he has found, they seem to be 40-50 degrees off the orbits of the gas giants. some are in extremely comet like orbits and at least one is on its way out of the solar system. i am no scientist. a lot of what i read about it makes little sense with current theories. unless there is something out there that is big enough to drag small planets and moons out of their original orbits around the sun. some think we have a brown dwarf about a light year out at the edge of the sun’s influence(gravity). so far no one has found it. i think we are looking in the wrong places. if there is a brown dwarf, it is quite small as stars go. if it is in a comet-like orbit, then somewhere down the road it will return causing all kinds of changes in the solar system. if it has planets around it, then those planets might cause a lot of destruction as they come close to existing planets and moons in our solar system. our planets as viewed from the north and top of the solar system rotate around the sun counter-clockwise. if this brown dwarf is rotating clockwise around the sun, that might complicate finding and plotting an orbit for it. if it is way off the angle that most planets orbit the sun, that might also keep it from being discovered. i do find it interesting that a lot of astronomy telescopes are moving towards the south pole for observations. known brown dwarf stars do exist around stars in our stellar neighborhood and some are independent of any other stars all within about 12 light years of our sun. a lot of what we do know is kept fairly low key and doesn’t really get a lot of news headlines. how many people know about dr. brown’s work in the outer solar system? how many know about the gap(hole) in the orbits of the orb cloud? a gap big enough for something the size of venus or much larger could have made in the outer asteroid belt. i think it is possible that an object possibly the size of a gas giant might be out there somewhere but so little light is coming from it that we will only discover it by accident. what is significant is we are still learning about new planets in our own solar system. the governments have spent enormous amounts of money in this area through nasa. so someone must think we have things out there we need to know. grimreaperlady i found your reply facinating! there is no way we are the only planet with life. i think i am going to go read some scientific journals, any suggestions. jaxon64 awesome distraction technique…you turned a discussion of govt media control and trolling into a lengthy discussion of planetary formation?…truly masterful. you deserve a raise. djohn1 thank you. just for the record, i have no salary from the u.s. government for trolling. the only funds from them i see is my monthly social security check as someone that has retired. not sure how long that lasts before they steal what they haven’t all ready spent out of the general fund. the true masters are the pr people hired to keep the sheep all sleeping peacefully while the government steals everything in sight. i started getting suspicious about 20 years ago, when the entire newspaper business stopped mud raking and went with bland stories handed out by the wire services. it appears stirring up things has legal penalties and newspapers do not want to get hung up in legal battles. so they run news from wire services and leave the real reporting to others. making advertisers angry has financial penalties as well, so lord help the reporter that angers an advertiser. everything is wrapped up in money motivations. that above anything else is what has destroyed the country’s estate that used to bring down the crooked politicians. the only way this related to planetary formation is that this media was used to go against this man by scientists that were angry at his claims. these scientists literally boycotted the publishers willing to pub his work. my own thought is that controling the scientific discovery press is just as bad. jonathon von tischner a good video on that is “return of the nephilim” by chuck missler. djohn1 immanuel velikovsky wrote the book in question. worlds in collision was the title. he was wrong about a lot of things. for instance i do not think it is possible to have venus come out of jupiter. the elements are different. venus has a heavy core vs jupiter has a hydrogen and helium core. what he did get right was a lot of facts about what venus actually consisted of. my own idea is venus might have been a wondering planet not orbiting any star. i mentioned this man because by coincidence he did get a lot of things right. his ideas should not have been debunked or censored in any way. how was venus created? i think it might have come from brown dwarf that was coming apart at the seams. that would make it a whole lot older than velinkovsky thought. the idea is brown dwarfs might have a lot of heavy materials on them than regular stars and gas planets. we have an entire solar system full of heavy objects like that. we also have at least 4 gas giants that consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. the question is where did all of those heavy material objects consisting of nickel/iron cores come from? that is a question that most astronomy scientists do not have a good answer yet. 2¢wurth wow, less than two sentences into the article and the icon of gary2 started appearing on the left and right sides of the screen. i used to think of a troll as a small ugly creature, now i think of this perverted looking plastic muppet who barks out this “take from the rich, give to me” mantra. must be very weird living in that world… chris yes the purple colored cookie monster from sesame street! seth half my comments get deleted or trolled outright. there is little to no freedom of speech in the west. heck, other countries are the lands of the free, relatively speaking. blackciti_fo5 so they’re doing with the internet what has already been done to television basically? great. just great. eric blair those who propose that only one perspective is viable and that all competing viewpoints should be abolished by decree are the worst trolls of all, no matter what ideals they hold up to justify their actions. america was founded on the idea of freedom, and primarily freedom of speech and ideas. any who would seek to deter that freedom are as tumors on the political body of this country, and as such should be excised lest their disease continue to spread. goebbels and bernays would be proud of such people, but they have no place in a truly free country. nicholas mull yes brotherjohnf we have been telling people this for years as we have battled these trolls for more than a decade. people just refuse to believe it. sad. syrin anyone reading my unrelenting attacks on gary at michael’s other web site knows that i believe without a doubt he is a paid disinformation gov’t agent. no one can read the facts that michael presents, and logically reach the conclusions he does when faced with pages of data and facts unless they are brain dead or have an agenda. he might have both. guest lol. i don’t think gary is a disinformation agent. i think he’s just an angry man who feels that he’s owed something. but that’s just my opinion. jaxon64 agreed…now gay vet may actually be a troll. gary at least discusses the issues,-albeit from his redundant and close-minded viewpoints which are inalterable by facts—yet gay vet and a few others are always trying to distract from the topic and turn any intelligent discourse in the comments section into a name calling and repub vs democrat discussion. his very name was probably chosen to distract from article content. another tactic i see from some here consistently is that if anyone mentions any faith, or god or just finishes a post with “god help us”…then trolls who never post anything else will pounce in and start attacking god—i think the true motive is to turn the conversation toward one of atheism/religion/creation instead of the topic of the article… you see it from the same people over and over–then they disappear and someone new with a different moniker will take their place ( quite possibly the same shill but different name.) all said, they are very effective at distraction if one reads through the comments, they often take over an entire article and it never gets back on topic. gay veteran speak of trolls and jaxon64 pops up. “…yet gay vet and a few others are always trying to distract from the topic and turn any intelligent discourse in the comments section into a name calling and repub vs democrat discussion… hey einstein, get a clue, there is no differences between the 2 parties …his very name was probably chosen to distract from article content….” i’ll choose my own name, j-hole. “…another tactic i see from some here consistently is that if anyone mentions any faith, or god or just finishes a post with “god help us”…then trolls who never post anything else will pounce in and start attacking god…” or you post something incredibly stoopid and get hammered for it firstgarden you know a tree by its fruit. veteranforpeace some folks take pride in being prime slime. they’re so desperate for attention that any kind would be better than none. veteranforpeace they’ll do it for buck too, paid prime time slime. facts seldom stand in the way of what someone wants to believe english kev i think gary has genitalia dimension disorder. syrin michael, i actually believe the gov’t push to take over the internet will help america. why? because most americans are fat, lazy brain dead zombies who let jon stewart do their thinking for them. they’re intellectual sloths and are 100% unaware of the noose being placed around their neck. however, they are internet addicts, and take away an addicts fix, and he/she will react potentially violently. it might just shake enough people from their stupor to effect meaningful change. firstgarden how dare you speak my mind? :-) media-mesmerized couch potatoes. derp so basically, what you’re saying is that the only way to save the internet (and all that it represents) is to destroy it? apple cider your beliefs step on the rights of free citizens and we are not here to serve your needs. please stick your head in a bucket of water and drown yourself. gay veteran you’ll get more truth from jon stewart than from the corporate media (including fox) rkb100100 public sector employee unions troll everything. firstgarden the new “free speech”– no speech tolerated but their own. (if you disagree, you’re automatically a hater and a phobe.) the new “diversity”– everyone except veterans and white males in their 50s. the new “constituency”– left wing voting blocks (formed by tax incentives to corporations for target hiring; promotion of welfare vs. workfare.) rastus their father is the “father of lies” firstgarden aye, but he is an equal-opportunity father, with children in many a camp. derp freedom of speech means that you have the freedom to speak your mind. that doesn’t mean that what you say is automatically correct or true. firstgarden you’re correct. unfortunately, statism does not tolerate free speech, dissent, nor true diversity. joey d’fixer i dont know why they even bother anyway. its not like this garbage works and they are so easy to spot. for instance, on yt, they are always a dead give away, as for 95% of the time, they use a first and last name, which from what i can tell, is autogenerated through some script they use. i had seen in a video, the fedbizopps site putting out a contract for a system to make multiple ids for use in some social media program. if i recall, it was the air force or something like that. operation earnest voice was another one as well. but they basically log in through some front-end of sorts, and they dont actually use yt like we do. the profiles are always empty: no dates, no vids, no likes, no uploads, no playlists, nothing on the ‘about’ section. its all pure vapor. and cass sunstein was the one who recommended all this in his paper, calling it ‘cognitive infiltration’, and who is another dr goebbels wanna-be and who should be hung from a tree. and its not like they are ‘going to change our minds’ on anything. troll or no troll, if i dont like what youre saying to me, i have 3 words for you ‘go f yourself.’ this is what actually enrages me more than anything, that they feel everyone but themselves, are going to be that malleable, zombified and sloth-like, to just believe everything they spew. if its one thing i hate, its people with superiority complexes, they are just a total scourge on the planet and its mindset of every control-freak authoritarian out there, past, present and future. randall thrift the illusion of privacy is just that, an illusion. my granddaddy always taught me that once an idea, thought, or opinion leaves you mind it is no longer private and you no longer should have any expectations of privacy. in today’s world of the high tech social media this truth is more evident than ever. grimreaperlady wow that is scary, this my last post until i think this through. captain canuck yeah if you guys are worried about obama’s nsa, then you wouldn’t believe prime minister harper. he’s diabolical. he’s managed to remove or control most press and cameras from parlaiment hill. this is huge, as media used to have access and reporters had a presence at the capital. he’s also managed to muzzle anyone who comes out and questions the big oil agenda. c p corrupt governments hate free speech, and ours will be gone for good with the next major terrorist attack or natural disaster. then the internet will be every bit as dumbed down as the broadcast media. blitzkrieg oh gay veteran… paging gay veteran. blitzkrieg …and gary — if they’re not already the same person. gay veteran sorry junior but i detest our fascist government charles reece by the way, since britain and america are both english-speaking countries – and the closest of allies, along with france; that therefore, england is already “in league” with whatever almost everthing that the u.s. does in the first place, and therefore, given edward snowden’s revelations of the u.s. government’s intelligence apparatus “spying” on its own citizens; that accordingly, why not expect britain to do the “same” – to not only their own people, but also ours as well, anyway. and besides, truly, during the 1960’s, the english-speaking countries; such as england itself, and canada, australia, and new zealand have already been sharing “signals-intelligence” information – or electronic “eavesdropping” information – with each other and with uncle sam; through the echelon electronic eavesdropping network; which was set up back in 1964. by each member nation of echelon electronically spying on each other’s respective private citizens – and passing on intelligence-gathered information to the other member nations; that consequently, each member nation could actually circumvent their own respective government’s laws prohibiting echelon from “spying” on its own country’s citizens. they’ve been doing this ever since echelon was “set up” back in ’64. but very few americans have already known about what’s been “going on” all of these past five decades; that being, with echelon members permitting each other to electronically “spy” and “share” intelligence information dealing with each other’s country’s citizens. thus, by one member nation allowing another one to gather information on its own citizens – and sharing that same “information” with the others; that consequently, each member nation could not legally be “accused” of violating its own respective government’s laws prohibiting domestic spying. bart simpsonson hey, it’s just another means of getting the prog’s agitprop out there and countering any notion of free speech on the internet. in case you haven’t noticed they also pretty much have the non-fox tv news networks, channels, and programs fellating them daily……. james it’s not really a surprise tho is it? and i don’t think it’s a lib vs dem thing, i imagine most governments do it. and it’s not just governments either. big business is up to exactly the same thing. big pharma, oil companies spreading disinformation about climate change. sad times we live in really, difficult to know who to trust on the internet these days. we all seek out the stories and opinions that support our view on the world. butidigress in any society, most people do nothing. it’s up to the minority to defend the naive majority. it’s how things are done. bob g if i read the article correctly the government is targeting conservative thought. i always wondered why liberals would deliberately read conservative web sites and then harass the commentators. i certainly have no wish to read liberal web sites let alone comment on them. it all makes sense now. ogis the dnc is behind a lot of this. false flag operations to make “conservative” posters sound ignorant, stupid and racist. (not to say that there are not elements of that in many conservatives and liberals, but these j@ck@sses ramp it up to 11.) tami chapman i almost posted this until you mentioned the harvard student’s article, which was taken totally out of context. great article until the very end when you very sneakily try to place all of the blame on liberals when we all know the the real villains completely control both parties, especially the conservatives. it’s independents like sanders who will fight for our rights…people who are not bought by the power elite. anonymous donor pays $2.5 million to release everyone arrested at the dakota access pipeline starkmana caddo nation tribal leader has just been freed after spending two days behind bars in north dakota. family members say she was simply an innocent bystander in a clash between police and protesters, and was not guilty of anything the police claimed. via alternativenews jessi mitchell, of local news 9 reports that “family members of caddo nation chairwoman tamara francis-fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on thursday at the dakota access pipeline site.” they added, however, that francis-fourkiller was never supposed to have been arrested in the first place. “an expert on sacred burial grounds , francis-fourkiller was one of the tribal leaders visiting the sioux of standing rock to advise them during negotiations with the dakota access pipeline construction team,” mitchell continues. “remains were being desecrated in this pipeline, so they had asked a bunch of people to come up there, so there’s a big conference,” francis-fourkiller’s sister loretta francis explained. on the visit , francis said her sister and other leaders decided to tour the protest camps. they never thought they would wind up in jail. francis said her sister had no access to her medication while in custody in cass county, north dakota, and now faces charges of conspiracy and rioting. “part of my family was removed on the trail of tears and they came here to oklahoma and they suffered,” said francis. “i always feel like each generation – our parents, our grandparents – try to make it better for the next generation and they certainly didn’t want this for my sister.” dozens of native americans from oklahoma tribes had gathered saturday afternoon at the state capitol, according to mitchell, with the purpose of voicing their “anger at the treatment of the protesters in north dakota, pointing out this week’s acquittal of armed protesters at an oregon wildlife refuge earlier this year.” “we’re not holding guns. we’re not armed, and when we see the military right here in the us use that on us, it’s shameful,” comanche nation tribal council member sonya nevaquaya explained. one of the fundamentals of all native american tribes is the protection of the land. chanting “water is life!” saturday, the oklahoma demonstrators hope to rally people from around the country to stand with those in north dakota and stop construction on the pipeline project. “these pipelines, you hear of a lot of bursts and leaks and it contaminating the waters. what happens when all of our waters and resources are gone?” nevaquaya explained. francis-fourkiller says she will be traveling back to her home in norman as soon as possible. fbi closes in on hillary!

visions of a new republican party email since donald trump entered the election over a year ago, he has single-handedly destroyed the gop, leaving both the house and the senate in utter disarray. but although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done, conservatives shouldn’t lose hope yet, because speaker of the house paul ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new republican party. a fresh gop platform requires fresh leadership, and when speaker ryan journeyed to south america last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth, he just proved he’s the only one for the job. after traveling to peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel, 200 mg of dmt, and a bucket to vomit in, paul ryan (r-wis.) spent the last 12 hours lying nude on the jungle floor, enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified, more moderate gop unfold before his very eyes. while under the influence of the powerful psychedelic, ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman, instructed him to remove his clothes, and held him down as lifelike projections of republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies, all to create a republican party that mobilizes key voter constituencies. check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the amazon rain forest! whoa. democrats have been pretty confident this past year, but if paul ryan’s visions of the republican party are right, they better watch out! say what you want about paul ryan, but he’s a man who refuses to give up. on the one hand, is it possible that the speaker’s grand ayahuasca visions of a new republican party are just a temporary fix? sure. but on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind. one thing is for sure: paul ryan emerged fully nude from that ayahuasca tent with a new perspective, and people are starting to take notice. massachusetts cop’s wife busted for pinning fake home-invasion robbery on black lives matter massachusetts cop’s wife busted for pinning fake home-invasion robbery on black lives matter source: pinac the wife of a massachusetts cop is facing charges for filing a false police report after she concocted a story about thieves ransacking her home, stealing $10,000 in jewelry and then spray-painting her house with black lives matter to pin it on black people. maria daly, wife of millbury k-9 cop daniel daly, took to social media about her dreamt-up victimization after she filed a police report on october 17. “we woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping, but to see this hatred for no reason,” she posted, according to the boston herald. “ if you would of [sic] asked me yesterday about this blue lives and black lives matter issue my response would of [sic] been very positive [sic],” the now private facebook account alleged. “today on the other hand i have so much anger and hate that i don’t like myself. this is what we have to deal with these days and it makes me sick that this is what was on the side of my house.” maria daly called police to report someone had robbed her home while she was sleeping and then spray-painted her home with blm for black lives matter then posted about it on social media. millbury police chief donald desourcy told the herald that daly called police to report an early morning break-in october 17, claiming someone had made off with thousands of dollars worth of valuables and spray-painting “blm” on the outside of her house. but chief desourcy stated that as the investigation unfolded, something didn’t feel “quite right” and daly ended up admitting she fabricated the whole thing, telling the officers her valuables had already been recovered. “it was pretty obvious. the officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had,” he told cbs boston . “we came to the conclusion it was all fabricated. there was no intruder, there was no burglary.” the chief said the hoax was likely motivated by the couple’s financial troubles and that he has empathy for the family. “i’m very familiar with her and it’s an unfortunate set of circumstances that have taken place.” daly’s neighbors said it wasn’t a very smart thing to do for a woman who is married to a cop. “she must have tagged the place herself,” said one neighbor. “i don’t know why you’d do that, if you’re gonna stage a robbery, i mean really come on, you’re a cop’s wife. you should know better.” in addition to charges for filing a false police report, daly also faces a charge for misleading a police investigation. her cases will be heard at worcester district court after she is summoned. daly’s husband, daniel daly was not involved or charged in relation to the hoax, according to police. share this article... nukes and the un: a historic treaty to ban nuclear weapons ira helfandemail in an historic move the united nations first committee voted thursday to convene a conference next march to negotiate a new treaty to ban the possession of nuclear weapons. the vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe. dismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under article vi of the non proliferation treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals, and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war, more than 120 nations gathered in oslo in march of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons. the conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used. it was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers, the us, russia, uk, china and france, the five permanent members of the un security council, or p5. further meetings in nayarit, mexico and vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the austrian government to “close the gap” in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons. more than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the united states and the other nuclear weapons states, and in the fall of 2015 the un general assembly voted to establish an open ended working group which met in geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved thursday. the united states, which led the opposition had hoped to limit the “yes” vote to less than one hundred, but failed badly. the final vote was 123 for, 38 against and 16 abstentions. the “no” votes came from the nuclear weapons states, and us allies in nato, plus japan, south korea and australia which have treaty ties to the us and consider themselves to be under the protection of the “us nuclear umbrella”. but four nuclear weapons states broke ranks, with china, india and pakistan abstaining, and north korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations. in addition, the netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of nato and abstained, as did finland, which is not a member of nato but has close ties with the alliance. japan which voted with the us against the treaty has indicated that it will, nonetheless, participate in the negotiations when they begin in march. the us and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the general assembly later this fall, but, following thursday’s vote, it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in march, and that they will involve a significant majority of un member states, even if the nuclear states continue their boycott. the successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons. but it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the non proliferation treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs. we have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years, and we have been incredibly lucky. us nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future. we need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated. this will not be an easy task, but we really have no choice. if we don’t get rid of these weapons, someday, perhaps sooner rather than later, they will be used and they will destroy human civilization. the decision is ours. ira helfand , md, is past

rally amanda sheahumiliated hillary tries to hide what camera caught 15 mins before rally posted on october 27, 2016 by amanda shea in politics share this hillary clinton outside rally (left), fox news catching incident on live feed (right) both presidential candidates stopped in the battleground state of florida this week to campaign for votes to crowds at separate locations. however, things didn’t go so well for hillary clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign — which backfired big time. while donald trump’s 15,000-person army of “deplorables” were holding down the fort in stanford, florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make america great again, hillary was at a much smaller venue at palm beach state college. although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she’s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what trump was looking at in the same state. however, hillary’s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. perhaps hillary didn’t think anyone would notice, but fox business network was watching — and commenting — live. with just fifteen minutes before the democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. as the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. “here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in sanford, florida yesterday for mr. trump, 15,000. there’s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,” one host pointed out much to hillary’s embarrassment. “the clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there’s empty space here and she’s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. and i can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a trump rally this would absolutely be packed,” the commentators added. no matter how far ahead in the polls hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. on the other hand, there are trump’s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as hillary’s that these massive stadiums can’t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. if the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what’s expected at the polls, hillary can’t win, and if she does, americans should definitely question how that could even happen israel is becoming pivotal to china’s mid-eastern calculus http://journal-neo.org/2016/11/07/israel-is-becoming-pivotal-to-china-s-mid-eastern-calculus/ country: israel while china is silently playing an important role in the mitigation of the conflict in the middle east, which is an important market for the chinese goods, continuously deteriorating security situation, marred by the presence of numerous jihadi groups in the region, the necessity for china to have a strong anchor in the region has become all the more evident today than it was few years ago. the so-called “arab spring” has brought many changes in its wake. however, war being one of the most important outcomes of this “spring”, certain changes in the erstwhile foreign policy orientation of many countries, big and small alike, was expected. to this particular outcome owes the growth of china-israel relations that continue to develop stronger and deeper every year. facts speak for themselves: china’s total capital investment in israeli high-tech deals involving chinese businesses is expected to reach around $500 million by the end of 2016, compared to $467 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2012. and as times of israel reported recently, chinese acquisitions in israel have dramatically increased in the last few years. in march 2015, china’s bright food acquired tnuva , one of israel’s largest dairy companies for approximately $2.1 billion. similarly, in july 2016, a chinese consortium that included private equity firm yunfeng capital — founded by alibaba group founder jack ma – acquired israeli social games company playtika from caesars interactive entertainment online games unit for $4.4 billion in cash. in august 2016, chemchina completed its takeover of adama — considered one of the world’s leading crop protection companies — for approximately $1.4 billion. the high level of growth is—and it is not a coincidence—running parallel to the intensification and geographical spread of the conflict in the mid-east region, particularly in and around the suez canal region. while syria and iraq are direct victims of terrorism, many important countries such as egypt (read: egypt’s sisi is building ties with syria because of the fears of being the next target of jihadist militias) are only inches away from breaking down into shatters, pushing china to find an alternative route and construct an alternative geography of trade to steer its own business in the region. israel, as such, happens to be the best country in the region. not only is it politically and militarily stable, but its geographical location also makes it an apt candidate to qualify for partnership in china’s ‘silk road’ on its southern corridor, which is china’s route to europe. before the emergence of ‘jihadi’ groups in the middle east, china depended on the suez canal to reach its largest export destination: europe. with its trade volume standing roughly at €521 billion in 2015, and the volume of their bi-lateral trade crossing well over €1 billion a day , europe undoubtedly remains one of the most important markets for the chinese business, and with it remains the mid-east the only geographical entity to facilitate this trade. however, the presence of isis, al qaeda and other islamic extremist groups in the sinai are threatening china’s maritime trade. with over 95% of global trade being seaborne and china now as the world’s largest trading state, this is a serious challenge for beijing’s continued economic development. the crisis in the middle east is, therefore, directly threatening china’s economic interest. and, while china has already stepped in the crisis (read: china’s rear adm guan youfei recently visited syria to boost co-operation with the syrian army), this is not the only way it is following to protect its vital interests. this is where israel becomes important for china. the growing economic alliance between israel and china is moving forward with a $2 billion, 300 kilometre freight rail link connecting eilat, on the red sea, with ashdod port, on the mediterranean. the project, nicknamed the ‘red-med,’ was greenlit by israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s cabinet, and construction, which is expected to take five years, will begin within the year. about the link, netanyahu said, “it’s the first time we’d be able to assist the countries in europe and asia to make sure they always have an open connection between europe and asia and between asia and europe.” while israel is clearly poised to play a pivotal role in providing an unhindered and a secure trade route for european and asia countries, china’s primary motivation is not to merely to build a network of allies in the middle east. for china, the primary concern remains, apart from its trade with the mid-eastern countries, access to europe and the african continent via the middle east. however, both of these concerns cannot be effectively satisfied when the entire region remains under crisis. china, due to its fairly balanced approach to the crisis and the fact that it is perhaps the only global player that continues to enjoy equally good relations with such arch rivals as, for instance, israel and iran and saudi arabia and iran, is an important country for the regional countries to look up to as a conflict mediator. this assumption about china playing this role owes its existence to the geography of trade china is eyeing to build through the mid-east. as an alternative to shipping through the crowded suez canal, china sees value in sending goods into the persian gulf, and shipping them overland to the mediterranean via several lines that could cross through saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar or even southern iraq before finally continuing through jordan and israel. will china eventually built this geography or not is a moot question. however, it is quite obvious that regional countries are open to it and know the potential benefits it can yield. speaking at to the inaugural signal conference on israel’s china policy at the idc in herzliya in the last week of september, capt. yigal maor, director general of the israel’s transportation ministry’s administration of shipping and ports, said that if china invests in building those paths, which he dubbed igec – the israel gulf economic corridor – it could push gulf countries into more formal ties with israel. “maybe with the help of china there will be peace in that area,” he said. whereas such prospects signal israel’s own elevation from the position of a us “protected” state to an important power, integrating the region, as also continents, the potential entry of the “dragon” in the region, connecting various countries into a whole, is likely to yield important results for the whole region. while we may have to wait a little to see what impact it leaves exactly, it is quite obvious that china is poised to become an important player in the mideast security scene, and is already asserting its role economically, diplomatically and, to some extent, militarily. salman rafi sheikh, research-analyst of international relations and pakistan’s foreign and domestic affairs, exclusively for the online magazine “ new eastern outlook ”. popular articles re: why we are still in ‘the danger zone’ until january 20th, 2017 greanfinisher .why we are still in ‘the danger zone’ until january 20th, 2017 17th, 2016 donald trump is not the president yet, and barack obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the white house. prior to the election, i described the period of time ending on january 20th as “the danger zone”, and my outlook has not changed just because donald trump was victorious on election night. as you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through january 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). on the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of trump’s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard. and the truth is that donald trump has not even won the presidency yet. as i detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until december 19th when the electoral college meets. on monday, december 19th the members of the electoral college will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. it is then, and only then, that the next president of the united states will be elected. throughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been “faithless electors” before, and if democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in december it is still possible (though not probable) that hillary clinton could win the election. one petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. the petition claims that donald trump is “unfit to serve” as president, and that since hillary clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. the following comes from a usa today article entitled “ could the electoral college elect hillary clinton instead of donald trump? “… a change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the electoral college to cast their votes for hillary clinton when the college meets on dec. 19. the petition argues that donald trump is “unfit to serve” and that “secretary clinton won the popular vote and should be president.” “if they all vote the way their states voted, donald trump will win,” the petition states. “however, they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose. even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay! we are calling on the electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton.” personally, i don’t believe that this is going to happen. they may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome. however, that is not the only concern we are facing. ever since his victory on november 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against donald trump and his family. and without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep donald trump from getting to inauguration day. so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family. if donald trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december 19th, mike pence would take his place. but if something were to happen to him before december 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate – including hillary clinton. if everything goes smoothly and donald trump successfully makes it to inauguration day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history. in an article for the most important news , i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington d.c. on january 20th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible. this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag “#disruptj20″ is being widely used all over social media. traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot. let us hope that they are not successful. another reason why we will be in “the danger zone” over the next two months is because of what barack obama may choose to do at the united nations. now that it looks like donald trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on barack obama to do something at the united nations regarding the israeli-palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense. and this is something that trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. in fact, i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the trump team is warning obama “against making moves on the israeli-palestinian conflict in his last months in office” … saying that pushing agendas “contrary to the president-elect’s position” would not be in the “spirit of the transition”, trump national security advisor for donald trump last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israeli-palestinian conflict in his last months in office. “on big, transformative issues where president obama and president-elect trump are not in alignment, i don’t think it’s in keeping with the spirit of the transition…to try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elect’s positions,” the advisor told politico . specifically, the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state, set the parameters for a “two state solution”, and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state. just a few weeks ago, an article in the wall street journal entitled “ obama’s israel surprise? ” reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now. a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians, and it would be something that president trump would not be able to undo. the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of barack obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. the following comes from an article by leo hohmann … the wall street journal reported one week before tuesday’s election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old israeli-palestinian conflict. israeli diplomats, according to the wsj story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck president obama “may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations.” the president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen. he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the u.n. before he leaves office , wsj reported. if barack obama decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating. but if we can get to january 20th and the land of israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because trump has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians. when politicians are going to do something that they know people won’t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people aren’t paying attention. for example, yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in 1913 . so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas. if barack obama is going to stab israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times. my hope is that we can get through january 20th without anything going seriously wrong. if that happens, i know that i will be very thankful. and as i detailed in a previous article , donald trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on january 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the hebrew calendar. could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe? or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation? i believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions. “danger zone” brings back memories of kenny loggins and top gun. anonymous listen to her howlin’ roar metal under tension

they hate each other). let’s hope that trump’s presidency will be a successful one, and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country. back in 1985, i bought a brand new

i say eff ’em. america first! thelulzwarrior who f***ing cares? israel is not an us state so far, they would simply refuse to go along such a plan. paul patriot freedom loving americans (should) know what needs to happen if hitlery is said to be el presidente on december 19th. the left can whine, shout, protest and riot……its time freedom loving americans get the right mind set about standing up to tyranny……and apathy, passivity, fear and political correctness will prove ineffective. the liberty tree is getting mighty thirsty…..just saying! df nj there are many forms of freedom. you criticize the left but you just don’t understand it. here’s how the left thinks: “an old english judge once said: ‘necessitous men are not free men.’ liberty requires opportunity to make a living – a living decent according to the standard of the time, a living which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to live for. “for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people’s property, other people’s money, other people’s labor – other people’s lives. for too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness. against economic tyranny such as this, the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government. ” you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs. most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country. the sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value. but do not fear. every year the top 1% become richer and richer. every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages. marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a government’s currency collapse. once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less. see you in the breadlines comrades! хорошего дня jc teecher it is fairly evident that b hussein odrama is spewing his nwo rhetoric and propaganda overseas, as he attempts to assume the role of the world’s authoritarian. he was handpicked by the biggest nazi since

education, and economics. the four hidden dynasties. also viewed as die-nasty, if one is part of it. anything is possible in the next two months, and with the huge amounts of $$ invested into continuing an evil empire, the underworld/shadow gov, will use any and all means to make their plans come to fruition. all we as christians can do is prepare for the worst, and pray for the “will” of god, to become manifest for his purpose, pleasure, and fulfillment of the end of days, of this age. the time of the fulfillment of a 100 year generation since the planting of the fig tree/ house of judah, in israel, is drawing nigh. christ said the generation that sees it (nation of israel) replanted in the covenant land, will also see his return. glory glory hallelujah, we might just get out of this world………alive. not fly away in a pre-trib rapture (trap), but change in the twinkling of an eye, here, in this earth, to be a part of the “kingdom come, on earth as it is in heaven”. df nj we

comments the podesta emails - after hillary, john podesta had been seriously warned about the syrian chaos posted by: nmb | nov 18, 2016 1:59:59 pm | 1 although it is hilarious to see the hillary supporters throwing a massive tantrum about 'fake news,' it does make it clear just how powerful having direct access to information is in negating money, mainstream media capture and control, and government propaganda. i don't know how much the new trump presidency will change the us intelligence agency culture. but one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in syria. billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of syria. it should have a completely unremarkable us regime change operation: * send in the ngos to agitate locals * make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: \"simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!\" * wield the tremendous economic power of the us to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the un * flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * fake chemical attacks, us intelligence agency compromised un reports and inspectors, etc. all of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of syria. i think it is safe to assume the us intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume 'unauthorized' information from countries that are targets of regime change. the easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the us intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as 'terror propaganda' and us social media and internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources. posted by: stevens | nov 18, 2016 2:16:40 pm | 2

were 1950s usa manufactured vintage and date to a time when our federal government had good economic relations with the batista regiem. when i think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to cuba by our federal government all i can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of u.s. economic warfare. just as in the middle east and now europe economic sanction

much accepted the result of the us presidential elections and are glad that killer klinton's ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards. the focus is now on president-elect donald trump's likely cabinet appointments, who are the most likely choices for critical positions like defense secretary and state secretary, what the process is and how that is being carried out (or not carried out), and what that says about trump's leadership and decision-making style, how he plans on being president and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda (if it is genuine) of reforming the political culture on capitol hill, or \"draining the swamp\". if indeed trump is intent on bringing changes to capitol hill, then there's a strong likelihood that the soros-funded \"color revolution\" rioting around the us east and west coasts will come to washington and we'll be seeing a re-enactment of the kiev maidan events there. posted by: jen | nov 18, 2016 3:01:27 pm | 5 does the constitution of the united states require the president to have a specific number of executive departments? the answer is no. george washington only had four departments in his administration as first president of the united states. perhaps if mr. trump can't find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he \"drains the swamp\", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration. posted by: pokethetruth | nov 18, 2016

iran' was just a setup by the right, that was iran's sovereign national wealth held in overseas investments and illegally frozen by the right as an *act of war*. when obama agreed to end those illegal sanctions and let iran retrieve their investments (which they may have done today, if you look at the huge market selloff), the right again illegally crossed into iran territory with their navy patrol boats to create a false 'hostage' narrative. those navy boats know where they are by gps withing 3.5 meters (10 feet), and iran didn't beat them or waterboard them like abugraib or gitmo, instead, they traded them for their *interest losses* on their illegally frozen foreign investments. with huckabee as nee ambassador to israel, and neocon pompeo as named cia director, and jared kushner getting top secret briefings to pass along to his israeli blood-diamond partner lev leviev, you can bet the xtian soldiers will be pouring our blood and our treasure onto the radioactive sands of the

have very large and populous \"red\" areas--mostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity. my point is, that this possible (how probable--that is totally another discussion) civil unrest, once \"red\" states america gets involved seriously, will not last too long for a number of purely tactical, operational and logistical reasons. this is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process. blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since, as i already stated, \"red\" states' america is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry. it is also tougher. social and

38-year-old self-made titan of a fake news empire on facebook — is claiming responsibility for pushing donald trump to the white house, and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news. in an interview with the washington post, horner attributed his success to trumps’ particular base of supporters. he is the man behind such viral headlines as “the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump” and “president obama signs executive order banning the national anthem at all sporting events nationwide” — neither of which were true. “my sites were picked up by trump supporters all the time. i think trump is in the white house because of me. his followers don’t fact-check anything — they’ll post everything, believe anything. his campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. like, i made that up. i posted a fake ad on craigslist,” he told the washington post. posted by: jdmckay | nov 18, 2016 4:52:36 pm | 16 the coming conflict is between

servants and improvises everyone else. in the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it. brexit and the trump presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible. for globalism to proceed in the middle term, it will require a surveillance police state, total propaganda, reeducation camps and the shutdown of

psychohistorian | nov 18, 2016 5:12:13 pm | 20 it's great that there's some dialog between trump and putin. i think at least western syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. but trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. after the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically russia 1, us 0, he's not going to be so pliable. he sure as fuck isn't going to throw israel under a bus. he's not going to roll over on all american commitments in the region. trump's been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. it's no secret that until recently he couldn't have found damascus on a map. now he knows about the shiite crescent and how the arms can flow from iran to syria to hezbollah in lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for israel. now there's action towards taking raqqa by the kurds and who knows who else. the us and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. i'm surprised the kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the us a couple of months ago they're not going all in right now as things are ongoing in mosul and will be for a while. but you don't hear assad and the russians squawking much about it. it's like they both know that parts of eastern syria are bye-bye. trump's good will towards russia certainly doesn't extend to iran. and no american will ever call hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the marine barracks truck bombing in beirut all those years ago. if putin and trump are going to come to a general understanding in the me there's going to have to be some give and take. putin's done quite a turnaround in taking russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. it's looking good for him to keep his man in power in syria and to establish a permanent presence in the me with khmeimim and tartus. once trump is fully up to speed on the totality of american interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. there will have to be some serious deal-making. posted by: peter | nov 18, 2016 5:16:47 pm | 21 putin's done quite a turnaround in taking

are these articles: 4 of the best kinds of milk that aren’t dairy alexandria laredo now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesn’t actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. a study published in the british medical journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: the people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. the women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. it is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. there is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. a lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. this doctor describes it perfectly when he says “cow’s milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies.” it is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. while there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. here are some of the better “milk” products out there. almond milk raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where it’s coming from. as with many mass produced products, even some almond milks aren’t the best for us. an analysis of a uk almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. a single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. there is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: it has more potassium and more of the vitamins a and d. but almond milk is fortified with these nutrients — they’ve been added during the production process. making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances you’ve never even heard of before. rice milk rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you don’t mind the taste. it’s higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk. yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. during processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. it is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. if you’re trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but it’s certainly better than plain old dairy milk. coconut milk coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. when this milk is all natural, meaning there’s no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us. “ coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins c, e, b1, b3, b5 and b6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.” the things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. they have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. one of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. this gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. but unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. this is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! hemp milk ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks don’t. some companies make fully organic, non-gmo, and unsweetened hemp milk, but it’s always good to check exactly where you’re getting your products from. hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. it’s also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. in a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: vitamin a can i have one girlfriend without you bastards f**king it up? asks harry can i have one girlfriend

and the political realignment there critical to us understanding of the region...and to our future with israel lebanon has a new president. the political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country. on monday, lawmakers voted to pick general michel aoun as lebanon’s 13th president. the election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement hezbollah, especially after saad hariri, the leader of the march 14 alliance and a close ally of saudi arabia, voiced his support for aoun. on this edition of ‘the debate,’ press tv has asked two analysts why they believe hariri threw his weight behind aoun. nabil mikhail, a professor at the george washington university, praised hariri’s measure, adding that with this decision, he actually wanted to bring stability back to lebanon and thus avoid syria’s spillover effects. hariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the lebanese society, mikhail said, adding that by his vote for general aoun, he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and, ultimately, save it from the repercussions of the syrian war. mikhail believes that the united states’ shrinking power in the middle east has forced hariri to face away from washington. “i believe that saad hariri could have been motivated, along with others, about a vision that america’s role in the middle east is receding. so, perhaps russia is the new reality in the middle east, is a new power. so, anything that is somehow close to russia will be better for lebanon,” mikhail argued. mikhail said that “so many things have transpired inside lebanon and inside the arab region within this year. i would assume that the syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the [persian] gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities.” “he (hariri) sees that syria has to be stable in order for lebanon to be stable. so, he is making calculations. i hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe. so, he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his syrian interests and [persian] gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this.” the image grab shows gordon duff (l), a senior editor of veterans today based in ohio, and nabil mikhail, a professor at the george washington university, at press tv’s ‘the debate’ show on monday night. meanwhile, the other guest on the show, gordon duff, the editor of veterans today , noted that, in his view, the reason behind hezbollah’s victory in michel aoun’s election is the movement’s victories in syria, especially in aleppo, which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories. “if aleppo falls, and aleppo will fall, it’s only a matter of how long, a victorious and highly-disciplined, highly-trained hezbollah force, [which is] heavily trained by russia and by iran, is going to return to lebanon. it’s a very different force and i believe hariri is looking at this. reaching out for what should be a very different hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in lebanon that has been out of control,” duff reiterated. related posts: сми сербии приписали россиянам \"подготовку терактов\" в черногории 0 комментариев 0 поделились фото:

во время своего визита николай патрушев встретился со всем руководством республики: 26 октября — с президентом томиславом николичем и главой мида ивицей дачичем, а 27 октября — с премьером александром вучичем. все переговоры прошли в строго закрытом режиме. в самом начале визита было официально объявлено, что патрушев предложил сербским властям подписать меморандум о взаимопонимании в области безопасности, который создал бы постоянный канал связи между москвой и белградом в этой сфере. однако профессор факультета безопасности белградского университета зоран драгишич уверен, что визит связан с тем, что произошло в соседней черногории, где власти объявили о предотвращении террористических акций в день выборов. этой же точки зрения придерживается сербский военный эксперт александр радич. источник \"ъ\" близкий к правительству сербии считает, что \"российский гость наверняка хотел бы прояснить наши шаги по сотрудничеству с черногорией в расследовании активности групп, готовивших беспорядки в подгорице 16 октября\". напомним, 16 октября в черногории состоялись парламентские выборы . в день голосования власти страны объявили о задержании 20 граждан сербии по подозрению в подготовке теракта и путча. по предварительным данным, группа планировала напасть на собравшихся перед зданием парламента граждан и полицейских, занять помещения скупщины с целью провозгласить победу одной из политических партий, лишить свободы премьер-министра черногории. утверждается, что лидером организации был экс-начальник жандармерии сербии братислав \"бато\" дикич. спустя несколько дней сербский премьер вучич сообщил, что службы безопасности страны задержали ряд лиц, организовавших слежку за премьером черногории. напомним, на парламентских выборах в черногории победила прозападная демократическая партия социалистов (дпс) премьер-министра мило джукановича. как рассказал ранее pravda.ru специалист института европейских исследований стеван гайич, \"даже если бы оппозиция признала выборы, разница между оппозицией и пронатовской партией джукановича — только в одном или двух депутатах. так что джуканович далеко не победил. джуканович провел эти выборы в атмосфере государственного переворота, во время выборов были выключены viber и whatsapp. оппозиция впервые за 27 лет сказала: хватит, не будем больше признавать нелегитимные выборы, потому что одним и тем же образом джуканович приобретает власть из года в год и уже 27 лет он находится практически в режиме абсолютного диктатора страны\". можно предполагать, что и сообщения о подготовке \"террористических актов\" могут быть частью политической борьбы в черногории - с учетом того, что от власти мило джуканович отказываться явно не собирается. спешка к \"европейскому будущему\": черногория в нато поделиться: sparking an inner revolution lance schuttler0 0 with humanity’s awakening continuing to speed up as every day passes, we see more and more people desiring information to help them better themselves. whether that is done through eating healthier foods, beginning a yoga or meditation practice, or whether it is done by being more mindful with the words they choose to use when having an inner dialogue or a conversation with friends and family, more people are looking for information to help them transform their lives in a positive way. while there are many methods to improving one’s life, below are some methods that can help a person spark an inner revolution to create positive and uplifting change in his or her world. grounding/earthing grounding, or what is also called earthing is when a person has bare skin touching the earth or a tree and is most commonly done by standing on the earth with one’s bare feet. doing this begins to balance the electrochemical state of the body because of the negative ions the earth emits. negative ions act as antioxidants (free-radical scavengers) by pairing up with the free radicals and rendering them neutral. thus, pain, inflammation and anything out of balance begins to move towards balance, or homeostasis. there have been several studies that have shown how grounding helps with pain reduction, wounding healing, balancing of the circadian rhythm to help improve sleep, as well as helping to shift a person’s brainwaves to the alpha state, which is great for a calm and balanced, yet alert and fully awake state of mind. standing barefoot on the earth, sand, dirt or concrete (not asphalt) will allow the free flow of negative ions to come in contact with the sensory neurons on the skin and begin to trigger positive physiological and psychological changes within the body. taking it a bit further, if a person is able to connect with the earth in a quiet place, the benefits could be even more as dr. joe dispenza has said , “in clinical studies, we have proven that 2 hours of nature sounds a day significantly reduce stress hormones up to 800% and activates 500-600 dna segments known to be responsible for healing and repairing the body.” burning sage in a 2007 study from the journal of ethnopharmacology , researchers found that medicinal smoke killed harmful airborne bacteria by up to 94% in just one hour. on a more spiritual level, burning sage has long been used to clear negative or disharmonious energies from a space. this can be done when a person comes home from work or school for that day, as burning sage can be a good way to clear any discordant energy the person may have “picked up” or had “taken on” from other people or their environment. it is used to clear away such energy so that a person can be centered in who he or she is, rather than having to deal with issues that might have been taken on from others. i personally do this each time after coming home from getting groceries or running and errand. essential oils the two best ways to use essential oils are to smell them as well as apply them to the skin. while applying essential oils to the skin has many of it’s own benefits, smelling them also creates wonderful responses in the body, and especially the brain. according to the university of minnesota , smelling essential oils’ molecules affect the olfactory organs, the lungs (and thus the respiratory system) as well as the brain. odor molecules travel through the nose and positively affect the limbic system of the brain, which is sometimes called the “emotional part of the brain.” to this end, the limbic system controls heart rate, mood, blood pressure, memory, breathing, stress hormone response and overall stress levels. applying or smelling essential oils throughout the day is a wonderful way to develop emotional intelligence and can help a person respond to stressful situations in a more positive way than before. smelling essential oils can be personally described as an uplifting and heavenly experience; one that allows us to smell the cosmic byproduct of thousands of flowers pressed into a wonderful gift for humanity. breathing exercises breathing exercises, which can also be considered a form of meditation, can have profound effects on the body and mind. according to deepok chopra , a regular practice of rhythmic deep breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, stabilize blood pressure, increase energy levels and decrease feelings of stress. over time, a breathing or meditation practice can lead to wonderful internal shifts both physically and emotionally. incorporating a deep breathing practice into the practice of grounding or earthing is a great way to accomplish both practices at once. here is an article of three sample breathing exercises from dr. andrew weil. while there are many other practices a person can use to help catalyze deeper inner growth, such as flower essence therapy (different from essential oils), nature walking, sun-bathing and the use of certain health supplements like fulvic acid and reishi , this list is a guide that may help those who may just be starting to experience an internal transformation. these four simple practices can be easy to incorporate into one’s life and is recommended to experiment with what feels best for that person. what of these practices do you use in your life? what other practices do you use to help you continue your inner revolution? share with us your practices or suggestions you have in the comments section. cheers to

nato's disaster-relief drills in montenegro, russia held special forces exercises with its balkan neighbour serbia on wednesday. in montenegro, which split from serbia a decade ago, nato is on friday due to wrap up a five-day disaster-relief drill of 680 unarmed personnel from seven nato members and 10 partner countries including serbia. \"it is in the interest of montenegro, in the interest of nato, and also in the interest of the region, to be part of nato and promote euro-atlantic values in the balkans, and these values benefit each and every one of us,\" montenegro's deputy prime minister dusko markovic , said about the exercise. across the border, in serbia, russia flew in its paratroopers along with allied belarus for an exercise called \"slavic brotherhood\", which according the serbian defence ministry focuses on \"fighting terrorism\". the drills are set to last until november 9 and will include 212 russian, 450 serbian and 56 belarusian troops. three russian transport planes have already landed in belgrade on wednesday bringing in soldiers and equipment. drills in the two former yugoslav republics reflect mounting tensions between russia and the west over a variety of geopolitical issues including conflicts in syria and ukraine. read more: russia is moving nukes west in response to continuing nato aggression in serbia, nato is hugely unpopular after its 1999 bombing ousted belgrade's armed forces out of its former southern province of kosovo. but as part of its integrations with the west, serbia last year signed the individual partnership action plan (ipap), the highest level of cooperation between nato and a country not aspiring to join. an eu candidate, serbia insists that it is militarily neutral, but maintains close ties with russia, its orthodox christian and slavic superpower ally, the biggest gas and oil source and an obstacle to kosovo's membership in the united nations. last year montenegro accepted an invitation to join nato, a move that soured relations withrussia. ahead of october's parliamentary vote montenegro's outgoing prime minister milo djukanovic accused moscow of meddling in country's elections and of financing the opposition. a fifth of the votes in the poll went to an anti-nato, pro-serbia bloc. article by doc burkhart , vice-president, general manager and co-host of trunews with rick wiles got a news tip?

individual & collective healing lance schuttlerthe trump election will spark more individual & collective healing nov 9, 2016 1 0 this article will not be a pro-trump or a pro-hillary piece. it will have little to do with politics and more to do with a much bigger picture. as everyone knows, many people are celebrating the trump victory and many people are mourning it. what is needed right now is a wider perspective at what is occurring. donald trump will become the next u.s. president. with donald trump set to take over the oval office in late january of 2017, there are many unknowns, just as it would be if hillary would have won. what is going to happen with health insurance? what is going to happen with immigration laws? what is going to happen with foreign policy in relation to other nations? more importantly, what is going to happen to us as individuals and humanity as a whole? individual healing while these questions need to be asked and will in time be answered, we must remember that we cannot give up our personal power to shape our individual lives. right now, many people are worried and many people are thrilled. regardless of our feelings on this election, we must remember that we alone are responsible for our individual lives as we make countless choices each day. how will i choose to treat others today? how will i choose to treat myself today? am i taking care of my physical body well by eating well and exercising enough? am i ensuring to get enough sleep throughout the week? what is it i can do today to become a better person? by either believing that one person is going to save or change your entire life or by believing that one person is going to ruin your entire life gives away your own personal power. the great philosopher epictetus once said , “it is not what happens to you, it is how you respond.” we always have a choice in our response to any situation. by either being saddened or thrilled at the perception that one man is going to either ruin or save your life is extremely dis-empowering. though each person has every right to feel how they want, it must be remembered where true power comes from: within . every person has the choice how they wish to respond to this election. are you going to wither away in frustration, anger and despair or are you going to make choices that help you to become the best person you can be? on the opposite side, are you going to sit back and believe your personal challenges are going to be fixed with a new president or are you also going to take action to become the best person you can be? regardless of who you did or didn’t support, we all need to reclaim our personal power and continue the trek towards bettering and healing ourselves, even if it is in the smallest of ways. collective healing on a wider scale, this election will give us the collective choice to where we wish to travel. do we wish to seek peace with other people and other countries? do we wish to have dialogue with nations previous administrations demonized? do we wish to communicate with and try to understand other people’s viewpoints or are we going to remain closed off to such opportunities for personal and collective healing and growth? additionally, are we going to continue to allow group-think to dominate our society by letting the media tell us what to believe, or are we going to begin gathering information from several sources to arrive at our own conclusions? are we going to question our leaders more and demand answers that are truthful and unbiased towards any specific agenda? will we do this both on a local and mass level? are we going to work towards cooperation or continue to live in a dying paradigm of competition? as physicist and author gregg braden says , “a growing body of scientific evidence, gathered from more than 400 peer-reviewed studies, is leading to an undeniable truth: violent competition and war directly contradict our deepest instincts of cooperation and nurturing. scientific studies show conclusively that nature is based upon a model of cooperation and mutual aid, not violent competition and war. we live in a world where everything is connected. we can no longer think in terms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live. today it’s all about we .” science has disproved darwin’s theory and shows us we must act in unison to transcend our collective challenges. i see this election as many other do: a massive turning point in our world’s evolution. i personally have full trust that we will look back at this time and see this as a positive, yet challenging event in that it empowered more people to begin taking action to create the kind of world they wish to live in. this turning point is allowing us all to shift our perception of the world and to initiate action towards creating a more peaceful, happy and abundant world for all. lance schuttler graduated from the university of iowa with a degree in health science

book title: true islam, jihad, and terrorism: the science of islamic foreign policy – jaan s. islam publisher: new york: nova science publishers isbn 978-1-63485-542-6. at a time of politics of fear, jaan islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, true islam, jihad and terrorism (nova science publishers, new york, 2016). during the 2016 us election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in today’s context. this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history, philosophy, and political science. this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun. jaan islam uses the so-called ‘islamic cognition technique’ and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition. this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. such an extension was first pointed by islam, zatzman and islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum. more... stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality, integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere: the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars, jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources, qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven ‘research’ about islamic history. the distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value. although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. it is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition. it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. the west does recognize averröes, the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands islam as just another religion, similar to christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. it is no surprise that with that starting point, islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west. chapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely hobbes, locke and ibn khaldun. in this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is ibn khaldun’s political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke. ibn khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. the author points out how ibn khaldun’s first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using qur’an as the origin and prophet muhammad’s life (through the book of hadith) as the pivotal point. one the other hand, locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point. the author makes it clear that both hobbes’ and locke’s cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. in my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun. in chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as rashedun caliphs). clearly, the author’s intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the qur’an they were enacting. for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the qur’an. no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time. similar to chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter 5. once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter. in chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life. the author makes it clear that islam didn’t leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. this is not an easy topic to cover even in today’s world. the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic. often when islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. if it is all that simple, why don’t islamic scholars have consensus? the author handles this topic like a pro. in chapter 7, he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist ‘scholars’ that have done great disservice to islam and/or scientific cognition process. one doesn’t have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. to anyone’s surprise, this list is not made out of anti-islamic non-muslim scholars. chapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. the author analyzes every major event of today’s political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. most interesting is the discussion on current us allies, such as saudi arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws. this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments. chapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. i have studied islam for some 30 years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. it is important to read the book in sequence. chapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive. chapter 11 is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation. anyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. quite interestingly, the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam. without the roof, the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever. this depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression. this book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, islam that means peace through submission to the creator. this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in today’s world. in this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace. if donald trump wins the election, it will be the biggest miracle in us political history the docif donald trump wins the election, it will be the biggest miracle in us political history posted on home » headlines » world news » if donald trump wins the election, it will be the biggest miracle in us political history are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time? from michael snyder : because as i will show in this article, that is precisely what it is going to take in order for donald trump to win. before i go any further, i want to make it exceedingly clear that i am not saying what the outcome will be on november 8th. as i recently told a national television audience, i do not know who is going to win. in this article i am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. but in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another “october surprise” or two before it is all said and done. and without a doubt donald trump desperately needs something “to move the needle”, because if the election was held today hillary clinton would almost certainly win. what we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. we have never had a bigger “october surprise” than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which donald trump claimed to grope women without their consent. we have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked donald trump. in the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. they should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. we have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. it has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the trump campaign. if donald trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of biblical proportions. as it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for trump. right now, the real clear politics average of national polls has hillary clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. but even if trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. in fact, trump could beat clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. in order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. and on the latest real clear politics electoral map, 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to hillary clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to donald trump, and 112 electoral votes are in the “toss up” category. so unless something dramatically changes, donald trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. let’s take a closer look at this. the first thing that donald trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that mitt romney won in 2012. that would get him up to 206 electoral votes. unfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. romney won north carolina, but the six most recent polls all have clinton ahead in that state. romney also won arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has clinton ahead by five points. but for a moment, let’s assume that trump can win all of the states that romney won. on top of that, there are four other states that trump must win… #1 trump must win florida’s 29 electoral votes. without florida, trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. so on election night if it is announced that trump has lost florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because trump is going to lose the election. unfortunately for trump, four recent major surveys all show trump down by four points in the sunshine state. #2 trump must win ohio’s 18 electoral votes. no republican has ever won the presidency without winning ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that trump and clinton are tied in the state. #3 trump must win iowa’s 6 electoral votes. fortunately for trump, most recent surveys show him actually leading in iowa. #4 trump must win nevada’s 6 electoral votes. at this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have clinton leading in nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. if donald trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. the most likely candidates for that last state are pennsylvania, michigan, wisconsin or minnesota. unfortunately for trump, clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. but even if trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that utah could still mess everything up. do you remember evan mcmullin? he was the third party “conservative alternative” candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. he is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is utah, and it turns out that evan mcmullin is a mormon. many mormons believe that a mormon will be elected president someday when the u.s. constitution hangs “like a thread“. according to this belief, this mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. many mormons thought that mitt romney was going to be this president, but now evan mcmullin has become the target of these expectations. so how in the world could evan mcmullin become president? well, their plan is to have evan mcmullin win utah, and that could potentially keep both donald trump and hillary clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. if that happens, the election would be thrown into the house of representatives. it is being projected that the house will still be controlled by the republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either trump or mcmullin, and those backing mcmullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. i know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over utah tonight. and in recent days evan mcmullin has been soaring in utah. one recent survey shows trump with a one point lead over mcmullin, and another recent survey actually show mcmullin leading trump by four points in the state. so trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and utah could end up messing up everything for him. in addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud. there was widespread evidence of “funny business” in 2012, and this is something that i detailed for a live studio audience down at morningsideearlier this month… are you starting to see why i would consider this to be the biggest miracle in american political history if donald trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? and we don’t have to wait until november 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the trump campaign. the following comes from cnn… democratic early turnout has stayed steady in north carolina compared to 2012, while republicans have dropped by about 14,500. in nevada, democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. and democrats are slightly ahead in arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging republicans in the tally of how many arizonans have requested ballots. perhaps most surprisingly, democrats improved their position in conservative and mormon-heavy utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. at this point in 2012, republicans led democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. but so far this year, the gop advantage is only 3,509. but if you do want trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before november 8th. we have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. in fact, i am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early november. so hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us. i wonder what glp will be like the day after the election? anonymous coward (uid 12781064)i wonder what glp will be like the day after the election? don't you? re: i wonder what glp will be like the day after the election? the servers will be

adminoregon live – by maxine bernstein a federal jury on thursday found ammon bundy, his brother ryan bundy and five co-defendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge. the bundy brothers and occupiers jeff banta and david fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility. kenneth medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property, and a hung jury was declared on ryan bundy’s charge of theft of fbi surveillance cameras. “more than we could have hoped for,” said one of ammon bundy’s lawyers, j. morgan philpot. “stunning,” said defense lawyer lisa ludwig, who was standby counsel for ryan bundy. “i’m just thrilled,” said neil wampler’s attorney lisa maxfield. the jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on thursday in the high-profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon. each defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. ammon bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the “not guilty” verdicts were read for him first. as he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, marcus mumford. his older brother ryan bundy stood. as his “not guilty” verdicts were read, he nodded, and mouthed to the jury, “thank you.” defendant neil wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer, maxfield. the coda to the stunning verdict, undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors, was when ammon bundy’s lawyer marcus mumford argued that his client, dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt, should be allowed to walk out of the court, a free man. u.s. district judge anna j. brown told him that there was a u.s. marshal’s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in nevada. oregon standoff defendant jeff banta is relieved by acquittals “if there’s a detainer, show me,” mumford stood, arguing before the judge. suddenly, a group of about six u.s. marshals surrounded mumford at his defense table. the judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. “what are you doing?” mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. as deputy marshals yelled, “stop resisting,” the judge demanded, “everybody out of the courtroom now!” mumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. ammon bundy’s lawyer j. morgan philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or taser, on his back. another member of ammon bundy’s legal team rick koerber, echoed philpot, saying he heard mumford questioning in court why they were using a taser against him. philpot decried the marshals’ treatment of mumford in the courtroom. “what happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,” he said. by 6:30 p.m., mumford was released from custody. he confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. “i grew up on a dairy farm, so am i used to some rough treatment, sure?” he said. but he said the actions of the u.s. marshals were uncalled for. “all i was asking for was papers. just show me you have the authority to take mr. bundy into custody.” as to the verdict, “very pleased, very gratified. this jury was dedicated. they listened to our case.” just after the verdicts were announced, people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers. supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug. one of them, brand thornton of las vegas, one of the original occupiers who accompanied ryan bundy and others onto the refuge on jan. 2 and was called as witness by the defense, said that he has been at the trial since oct. 2. the verdict “means everything,” thornton said. it’s huge for ranchers and land rights within harney county and across the west, he said. “we did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful,” said thornton, who has kept vigil outside the courthouse, blowing a shofar. “this is for the people of oregon,” thornton said. “this was never for us.” wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a “stunning victory for rural america.” david fry’s lawyer per c. olson said, “it was the right result.” “i think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,” olson said. the jury saw that the defendants cared about the hammonds and didn’t like how the federal government was treating them. maxfield, who represented wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. she said she has never seen “anything like this happen,” where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted, and called it one of the most significant cases in her career. defendant shawna cox said she had a “peaceful feeling,” as she waited for the verdicts, “but i didn’t expect we’d all be found not guilty.” “i wept,” cox said. “it brings me to tears. i’m so grateful to the jury.” defense lawyer matthew schindler, standby counsel to defendant kenneth medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments, said he called his client right away. “he’s been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him,” schindler said. “it’s vindication.” schindler said he believes the jury’s verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the “intent” of the defendants was to conspire against the u.s. fish and wildlife service and u.s. bureau of land management. “the judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendant’s state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations,” schindler said. when prosecuting a drug conspiracy, it’s easy to point to what the defendants’ underlying objective is. but in this case, schindler said, there was “no obvious underlying self interest.” he said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state, and not just from portland. oregon u.s. attorney billy williams sat in the back of the courtroom with oregon’s fbi special agent in charge gregg bretzing as the verdicts were read. williams left the courtroom early, before the scrum with mumford, to attend a gathering of the league of minority voters in salem thursday night. harney county sheriff dave ward, who was the face of law enforcement during the 41-day refuge takeover, said in a statement, “while i am disappointed in the outcome, i believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world. these folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers. this is our system, and i stand by it.” the five-week trial offered a rare display: three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves. five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify. and one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations – what the judge called an “extraordinary circumstance.” an alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors thursday morning. there was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial, with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests, and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings. often, supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings, and some kept vigil across the street, with one fellow occupier blowing a ram’s horn, or shofar, as the jury deliberated. pending prosecutions the seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge. eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. seven others are set for trial on feb. 14, but their cases may be affected by the verdicts. if convictions are handed down in this case, then defendants scheduled for trial in february might consider potential pleas. if there are acquittals, prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co-defendants next year. on the eve of jury selection in this case, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against pete santilli, an independent broadcaster and self-described “shock jock,” who provided live stream footage of the occupation. nevada case ammon bundy and ryan bundy also face prosecution in nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their father’s cattle near bunkerville, nevada. the trial there is set to start feb. 6. the two brothers and father cliven bundy are among 19 indicted in nevada. others from the oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in nevada are pete santilli, ryan payne, brian cavalier, blaine cooper and joseph o’shaughnessy. payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with nevada prosecutors, but he recently asked to withdraw the oregon plea because no deal was reached in nevada. prosecutors in portland have until oct. 31 to respond. cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases. o’shaughnessy pleaded guilty in the oregon case, with a deal pending in nevada. cavalier pleaded guilty in the oregon case. — maxine bernstein clinton campaign stunned as fbi reportedly reopens probe into hillary clinton emails the docclinton

director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced “in connection with an unrelated case.” he told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, “and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” he said the fbi could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete “this additional work.” bernie sanders says

then you shouldn’t run for office at all. — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) october 27, 2016 sen. sanders was correct. elections are supposed to be contests about ideas and visions for the future. however, the republican party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts, and hopes for visions. trump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory. it takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles. donald trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the oval office. the media will never say it, but real candidates for office don’t try to win by discouraging people from voting. the best candidates get people excited to vote and play their vital role in the democratic process. bernie sanders gets

man’s treasure? the same principle applies to our daily wastes. in case you did not know it, americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. actually, i would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that’s nothing to be proud of. we waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. also, as a nation, the united states generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. if you crunch these numbers– 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste – you’ll come up with astonishing numbers. putting waste to work for energy it was a greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted – everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. to follow this guy’s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . we, the preppers, can help mitigate the “disaster” and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. briquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material – usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust – that are used to start a fire. the terms derives from the french language and it means “brick.” biomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they’re used as a “green” replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. currently, almost half of the world’s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. cutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that’s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving humans, right? any household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making “fuel briquettes” using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. how to make the briquettes so, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? paper charcoal fines any other type of agricultural waste. it’s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. as a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to diy fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you’ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. there are also commercially available presses. you’ll just have to look for them on the internet or in the fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini bryant and peterson presses. you can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. video first seen on the do it yourself world . you can also use a plastic mold. video first seen on the do it yourself world . basically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. you’ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. you can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. here’s a cool idea about diy-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old dvd container. the possibilities are basically endless. video first seen on nobodyprepper . how to make briquettes in easy steps step 1 – preparing the briquette mix for example, if you’re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to diy and very efficient and cost effective), you’ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. in the next step, you’ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the “soup”. this step is very important but it takes some time and you’ll have to do it well. to speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. the simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. you can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they’ll add to the flavor. you’ll have to use roughly 20% paper though – that’s the lesson to be taken home. you can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper’s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. you’ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. in the next step, you’ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. the mix must hold together if squeezed; that’s how you determine the ideal consistency. step 2 – prepare the press this step depends on whether you’re using a cool home press or an improvised device. let’s say you’re on the low-tech side and you’re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. you’ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. you can use a hot wire to burn the holes. then you’ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. don’t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. obviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. ideally you’ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. don’t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though – otherwise, the water won’t drain and you’re wasting your time. step 3 – press the mix in this step, you’ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. then you’ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. push as hard as you can – the harder the better. then you’ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here’s your first briquette, folks. step 4 – dry your briquettes but it’s not over yet. you’ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. if they’re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and that’s unpleasant to say the least. if you can’t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and you’ll have to dry these out too, obviously. there are so many survival things you can do by yourself. discover wood creations. 5 total views, 5

most cringeworthy story you’re going to read all day. panasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. the company’s president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 panasonic tvs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. we’ll give you a minute to finish shaking your head. the scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the company’s popular dx802-model flat-screen tvs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. yikes. needless to say, panasonic customers are not happy! only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of god, panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: wow. panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! chances are, when you’re trying to stay competitive as one of the world’s foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. we’ve got to give credit where credit is due: at least panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. the company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, kazuhiro tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. speaking at a press conference this morning, tsuga issued the following statement: “after much consideration, i have chosen to step down as the president of panasonic corp. if i could, i would travel to heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. i would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these tvs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal panasonic customers on earth. even if i saw god sitting on one of our missing dx802 flat-screens, i would shove the lord off of the tv so that i could retrieve it for our customers. unfortunately, i do not have the power to travel to heaven, and so i am left with no choice but to resign my position.” tsuga’s resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesn’t bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. panasonic’s reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. whoever steps up to become panasonic’s new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again. judge spanks transgender-obsessed obama: you lie! | redflag news redflag newsdesk bob unruh | wnd for a third time, a federal judge has affirmed a nationwide injunction against the obama administration’s agenda to impose mandatory open-restroom policies on schools from coast to coast, scolding the white house for repeating old arguments and catching those who submitted the newest arguments in a lie. the ruling this week from u.s. district judge reed o’connor left intact his nationwide injunction against obama’s decision that transgender public school students can use the restroom of their choice, rather than the restroom designated for their physical sex. the white house issued the order some months ago, and when several states sued, o’connor found in august that they were likely to prevail in their arguments, so he suspended implementation of the program nationwide. in october, when he had to address the issue again because of demands from the white house, he doubled down, stating, “it is clear from supreme court and fifth circuit precedent that this court has the power to issue a nationwide injunction where appropriate. both title ix and title vii rely on the consistent, uniform application of national standards in education and workplace policy. “a nationwide injunction is necessary because the alleged violation extends nationwide. defendants are a group of agencies and administrators capable of enforcing their guidelines nationwide, affecting numerous state and school district facilities across the country.” now in another ruling prompted by demands from the obama administration, o’connor has affirmed the decision – again. huma’s weiner dogs hillary steve sailer colin kaepernick starts black panther-inspired youth camp? wow! scott osborn0 comments colin kaepernick has started a kids camp inspired by the black panther party, and their popular 10 point plan and said he didn’t want the media to find out. well i wonder why he would not want the media to find out he was taking such a far out approach with children? maybe his goal is to make little black panthers out of our youth? the ny daily news reports: please don’t say anything about it online,” colin asked me a few days before the camp. “i’m not doing this for the press and i don’t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.” nspired by the black panther party, and their popular 10 point plan, on their 50th anniversary, the camp created 10 rights that each child has the right to know. they were listed on the back of t-shirts given to each camper. “we’re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. we’re here to give you tools to help you succeed,” he said. “we’re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in america were based on, and we’re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.” why couldn’t kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids? why so secretive? why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group? kaepernick could have taken another road. he has instead taken an anti-american, anti-law enforcement road. he has chosen the road of hate and divisiveness instead of the road of patriotism and unity. kaepernick wants to pass this line of reasoning on to children. insanity on many levels. poison heather callaghanby dr. mark sircus everyone knows that there are psychopaths everywhere including in the fields of

before kayla brandonshare on twitter the battle of campaign rallies has been going strong throughout the 2016 presidential election, with both candidates amassing pretty large crowds. just last month, the washington post compared two separate september rallies for both donald trump and hillary clinton. trump's had a crowd of 15,000, at his sept. 27th rally in melbourne, florida: unbelievable evening in melbourne, florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in. thank you! #trumptrain #maga pic.twitter.com/2n3xq7agmx — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 28, 2016 ...while clinton had a crowd of roughly 1,400 people in raleigh, north carolina, that same day: hillary clinton rallies in raleigh, nc the day after the debate pic.twitter.com/pvwndh0zlk — sabrina siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) september 27, 2016 it appears as though fox business reporter adam shapiro felt the need to compare trump and hillary's crowd attendance, too. at a west palm beach rally wednesday, shapiro said there appeared to be roughly a thousand hillary supporters at palm beach state college, which was a sizable difference to trump's rally the day before: \"it's nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in sanford, florida yesterday for mr. trump — 15,000. take a look, stewart [camera pans crowd]. there's maybe 1,000 to 2,000 people here today. the clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there's empty space here.\" image credit: screenshot/ youtube he just couldn't stop talking about it, adding that if they were covering a trump rally, the room would be “packed.” though shapiro took a dig at the democratic nominee for her apparently “empty” rally, those who were in attendance still sang “happy birthday” to her. investment strategist forecasts collapse timeline: ‘the last gasp of this economic cycle will come in 2018’ mac slavoit is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the u.s. economy will collapse. that, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. the only question now is “when” that moment will come. according to christine hughes, chief investment strategist at otterwood capital , it will be very soon. basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, hughes says in her latest update to clients that we’re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 – 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . first, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: as the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. so let’s assume we’re like every other time in history and that happens. then it moves forward to 2018… so, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. we’re closing in on 2016 now… we basically have a year… maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. so if you are levered personally or corporately… if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff… the canadian housing market comes to mind… you might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. watch the video report: wolf richter of wolf street explains why the treasury yield curve is so important: since early july, the 30-year us treasury bond price index has plunged 8.3%. it’s now called “the rout” in longer-dated government bonds. one of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. what has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? the us treasury yield curve. it drives bank lending – which can strangle the economy. but this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. we know it is only a matter of time at this point. greg mannarino of traders choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. and when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: so, when the debt bubble bursts we’re going to get a correction in population. it’s a mathematical certainty. millions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. and i’m saying when not if… … when resources become more and more scarce we’re going to see countries at war with each other. people will be scrambling… in a worst case scenario… doing everything that they can to survive… to provide for their family and for themselves. there’s no way out of it. if mannarino and hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse . article reposted with permission from shtf plan don't forget to like freedom outpost on facebook , google plus , & twitter . you can also get freedom outpost delivered to your amazon

mitt romney or donald trump, democrats always run 'war on women' tactic to destroy the republican candidate natural news editors tags: war on women , democrats , campaign tactic (naturalnews) single women are a crucial element of the democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election. we may pause to remark that republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest mitt romney was leading a \"war on women.\"(article written by john howard, republished from breitbart.com )even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of \"strange new respect\" for romney this year. of course this new respect is pure political opportunism — and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as donald trump was in the good old days of 2016.we should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the left's revised opinion of romney to good use. what they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. they've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of russia, which means they're tacitly admitting barack obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. they razz trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.most pertinently, they turned mitt romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife ann romney into an out-of-touch stepford wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about \"binders full of women ,\" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.as for mrs. romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. when a mild backlash ensued, the white house memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]in the democrat imagination and campaign ads, republicans are constantly targeting american woman. you can draw a straight line from anita hill's hit on clarence thomas in the nineties, to \"journalist\" george stephanopoulos ambushing the republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.it's all pure opportunism, not principle. romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by peter thiel at the gop convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. there's precious little that could be twisted into a war on women narrative, even by the people who used sandra fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. therefore, the left ignores trump's policies and hits his character, while bill freakin' clinton gets ready to move back into the white house.in the nineties, democrats argued that clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to moveon.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion bill clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. he was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. they can only achieve personal \"independence\" through total dependence on the big government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in america who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (you're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]the great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled america with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.the dirty little secret known to the left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.so in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the \"implicit bias\" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.read more at: breitbart.com the geometry of energy and

conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. a visual meditation tool is called a yantra. mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. the image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. a mantra is the audio version of a mandala. a mantra is an audio meditation tool. whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. the terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. an asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. the postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. tantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. tantra unites entirety. tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. it is sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. it is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (mala beads are tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. though there is also a specific type of yoga called tantra yoga it means unification. there is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. there is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. and there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of yin yang tantra. the combination of yin and yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. this can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for yang potentials and circular for yin potentials. it can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. when straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. a spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. more broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - advertisement - essentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. an ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both buddhism and hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the yin and the yang. it also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. tantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. in essence, tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. there is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. a tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. no matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. no matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. and no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. seed of buddha meditation - advertisement - one of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from buddhist lessons. it is one of the most powerful meditations i have learned and as i learned it, buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. i learned this meditation from a tibetan buddhist monk from nepal before i considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. on later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. this meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. the profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. and each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. and that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. to begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. the rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. the nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. the process can be done in any time period. the point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. the meditation is formed from important buddhist concepts. many meditations are derived from such teachings, buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners. technocracy: the real reason why the un wants control over the internet activist postby patrick wood by its very nature, the internet corporation for assigned

sick reporter snuck in interview, has priceless response posted on october 27, 2016 by amanda shea in politics share this cnn’s dana bash (left), bash interviewing donald trump (right) donald trump stopped campaigning for just an hour-and-half to work in a brief appearance at the opening of his new hotel, whereâ reporters awaited his arrival â one of which had a nasty surprise hidden up her sleeve. when the republican candidate caught it mid-interview on live television, he had a priceless response that the cnn crank won’t soon forget. liberal news host dana bash is evidently no fan of donald trump, which she’s not afraid to show in her biased reporting. her arrogance backfired when she was in front of him at the grand opening of his hotel, thinking she could get away with a public attempt to insult him, but she got rightfully put in her place by the blunt candidate. trump’s schedule is jam packed with as many campaign stops as he can cram into these final weeks of the election, taking advantage of every waking moment to earn americans’ votes. somehow in the middle of his traveling to every corner of the country, he managed to squeeze in a stop at his hotel’s grand opening where he created countless jobs and a structure he should be proud of. however, bash didn’t see it this way in her attempt to slam him for this 90-minute “time off” he was taking from campaigning. during her live interview at the opening, the nasty cnn reporter had the audacity to sneak in this question: “for people who say youâre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?” she painted this pit stop as an irresponsible thing to do while hillary clinton is working hard. trump shuts down dana bash after questioning him for \"taking time off\" to attend his hotel's grand opening. đ pic.twitter.com/ltlau1jkbq — deplorable aj (@asamjulian) october 26, 2016 trump wasn’t going to allow her to get away with asking such a disgusting thing, given the vast difference in effort between him and his opponent and didn’t mince a single word in his priceless answer. “i say the following. you have been covering me for the last, long time. i did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. and iâve been doing this for weeks straight. i left for here for an hour-and-a-half. iâm leaving here and going to north carolina, then iâm going to florida, then iâm going up to new hampshire. for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. and yet you ask me that question. i think itâs a very rude question .” bash didn’t see that coming, and trump proved once again why america needs an unapologetic leader like him. he tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since it’s all for show anyway. trump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, he’s more than entitled to do it. it pales in comparison to the weeks hillary has had off relaxing and recovering. trump’s creating jobs as he’s campaigning, but hillary’s just napping. 10 images that perfectly illustrate the struggle against the dakota access pipeline the anti-media by nick bernabe the struggle to stop the dakota access pipeline has been mired in police brutality and militarization. in fact, many have likened the atmosphere in standing rock, north dakota, to a war zone. the corporate media initially refused to cover the dakota access pipeline protests, though the ongoing story’s virality on social media eventually forced it into the mainstream. even now that the #nodapl movement has developed into a national political narrative, the media continues to whitewash the severity of the crackdown against the native american protesters, who call themselves “water protectors.” below are 10 images i have come across (while closely following the dakota access pipeline protests for anti-media ) that narrate the struggle at standing rock: 85 years old elder wheeled

day after hillary’s benghazi hearing adminzero hedge october 26, 2016 in the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the clinton campaign and the doj, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by wikileaks, we learn that the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october, john podesta, hillary’s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including peter kadzik , who is currently a top official at the us justice department serving as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs. peter kadzik, with lobbyist tony podesta, brother of john podesta . the post-benghazi dinner was attended by podesta, kadzik, superlobbyist vincent roberti and other well-placed beltway fixtures. the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by vincent roberti, a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother, tony podesta. in it, roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto, a washington d.c. restaurant. the dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the benghazi committee . podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podesta’s home, another email shows . another email sent on may 5, 2015 , kadzik’s son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign. as the daily caller notes , the dinner arrangement “is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices.” as one former u.s. attorney tells told the dc, the exchanges are another example of the clinton campaign’s “cozy relationship” with the obama justice department. the hacked emails confirm that podesta and kadzik were in frequent contact. in one email from january, kadzik and podesta, who were classmates at georgetown law school in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate podesta’s birthday. and in another sent last may, kadzik’s son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign. a d v e r t i s e m e n t “the political appointees in the obama administration, especially in the department of justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and i don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says matthew whitaker, the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust, a government watchdog group. “ it’s the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton ,” he added, comparing the podesta-kadzik meetings to the revelation that attorney general loretta lynch met in private with bill clinton at the airport in phoenix days before the fbi and doj investigating hillary clinton. kadzik’s role at the doj, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. a long, friendly history podesta and kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal. as dc helps summarize, kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation. and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration, kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich, the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account. in a sept. 2008 email , which the washington free beacon flagged last week, podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. podesta, who would later head up the obama white house transition effort, wrote that kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “ kept me out of jail.” as the dc chuck ross notes, it is unclear to which case podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. but podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the lewinsky affair and the rich pardon scandal. as deputy chief of staff to clinton in 1996, podesta asked then-united nations ambassador bill richardson to hire the 23-year-old lewinsky . in april 1996, the white house transferred lewinsky from her job as a white house intern to the pentagon in order to keep her and bill clinton separate. but the clinton team also wanted to keep lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with clinton. richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered lewinsky the position but that she declined it. podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation. but he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. “he did lie to me,” podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in 1998. clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe. kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin & oshinsky, represented podesta through the fiasco. podesta had been promoted to clinton’s chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. kadzik was then representing marc rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the u.s. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. the fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. to help rich, kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan. 20, 2001. a house oversight committee report released in may 2002 stated that “kadzik was recruited into marc rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of white house chief of staff john podesta.” the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding rich’s pardon. on top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, rich’s ex-wife, denise rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon. she gave $100,000 to hillary clinton’s new york senate campaign and another $450,000 to the clinton presidential library. kadzik’s current role in his current role as head of the office of legislative affairs, kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues. in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation. the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton. but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress. last november, he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . in a feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to kadzik, florida rep. ron desantis noted that kadzik had explained “that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the attorney general when an investigation or prosecution by the department of justice would create a potential conflict of interest.” desantis, a republican, suggested that lynch’s appointment by bill clinton in 1999 as u.s. attorney in new york may be considered a conflict of interest. he also asserted that obama’s political appointees — a list which includes kadzik — “are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states. ” it is unknown if kadzik responded to desantis’ questions. kadzik’s first involvement in the clinton email brouhaha came in a sept. 24, 2015 response letter to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the doj was investigating clinton. last month, politico reported that kadzik angered republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether clinton aides who received doj immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. kadzik also testified at a house oversight committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the fbi’s files of the clinton email investigation. this article was posted: wednesday, october 26, 2016 at 9:52 am share this article anonymoussame people all the time , i dont know how you can fix this corruption http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/10_09_01_krongard.html why is this not watergate? smoking gun emails discuss “cleaning up” obama/hillary emails contributing author this article was written by tyler durden and originally published at zero hedge . editor’s comment: of course everyone knew, deep down, that obama was fully aware of hillary’s private emails, but now there is proof that the campaigns sought to cover up and clean up the evidence to it. team hillary went so far as to use bleach bit, a ridiculously thorough way of erasing one’s digital footprint. before she even takes office, she is embroiled in a scandal many magnitudes bigger than watergate… and yet… nothing. no one falls on their sword; no one drops out; no one is held accountable. it seems that “teflon” will out-survive even the cockroaches and nuclear wars… can all the media spin and vote rigging really hold all this together? can the fbi get away with looking the other way, and still pretend to uphold a nation of laws? will the american people accept her “victory” and go on about their daily lives? the smoking gun: cheryl mills tells podesta “we need to clean this up – obama has emails from her” by tyler durden recall that in a march 2015 interview with cbs, just after the nyt reported of hillary’s use of a private email server, president obama told the american public he had only learned about hillary’s “unusual” arrangement from the press. as we further reminded readers one month ago, cbs news senior white house correspondent bill plante asked mr. obama when he learned about her private email system after his saturday appearance in selma, alabama. “ the same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,” the president told plante. “ the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the blackberry i carry around, all those records are available and archived ,” mr. obama said. “i’m glad that hillary’s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.” unfortunately, the “transparency” of the obama administration was severely tarnished in late september , when in the fbi’s interview notes with huma abedin released by the fbi it was first revealed that obama had used a pseudonymous email account: “once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, abedin exclaimed: ‘how is this not classified?'” the report says. “abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.” to be sure, this was not definitive evidence that obama was aware of hillary’s email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the clinton campaign. that changed today, however, when in the latest podesta dump we learn that in an email from cheryl mills to john podesta, the clinton aide upon learning what obama had just said… i have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeozcx2m — katherine miller (@katherinemiller) march 7, 2015 … countered with something quite stunning: we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov that, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the clinton campaign. as a further reminder, politico previously reported that the state department had refused to make public that and other emails clinton exchanged with obama. lawyers cited the “presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the freedom of information act. it is therefore unknown what the president’s “alternative” email account was, or who hosted it. this also explains why in a prior wikileak, podesta told mills in an email titled “special category” that she thinks “ we should hold emails to and from potus? that’s the heart of his exec privilege. we could get them to ask for that. they may not care, but i(t) seems like they will. ” mills did not respond by email. the clinton-obama emails were turned over to the state department, which later announced it would not release them. * * * so just how did mills and podesta “clean up” the fact that obama lied to the american people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect hillary clinton. what we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between march 25-31, just a couple of weeks after mills said “we need to clean this up,” bleachbit was used to wipe hillary’s private server clean. but of course, that is purely a coincidence. since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of us government, or as cheryl mills dubbed it a “clean up”, perhaps it is time for the state department to unveil just what was said between the president and the clinton campaign? this article was written by tyler durden and originally published at zero hedge . “chapo trap house”: new left-wing podcast is a flagrant rip-off of the right stuff eric striker“chapo trap house”: new left-wing podcast is a flagrant rip-off of the right stuff eric striker october 27, 2016 these fags here. last march, a group of williamsburg trust fund bernie bros started a podcast called “ chapo trap house .”â the humor style and format of chapo trap house content is a left-wing carbon copy of the types of radio shows produced by alt-right sensation the right stuff , particularly the daily shoah, which uses opie & anthony style gags and parodies as a vehicle for delivering our counter-cultural and suppressed ideas. cth is trying to invert our ideas, bubble wrap the edges, and use our effective models to try and make leftism – an ideology that we have exposed and mocked into increasing irrelevance –“cool” by fixing some sunglasses to hide a weak (when put to reason) ideology. they have a small troll army on social media, they do (admittedly good) voice impressions, our counter-semitic tropes (at least one of the three is jewish) are replaced by mocking working class white people and christians, they have memes, albeit even more forced than dat boi , they make watered down attempts to pull down some high-profile liberal figures (like we do conservatives). they like to name drop famous comedians like trevor moore (of “ whitest kids u know ” fame) as personal friends and have fairly high profile leftist guests, which makes me think they have professional training or friends in high places. oh, and they spend most of their time attacking the alt-right, replacing cuck (our term for them) with “incel,” while demonstratingâ extensive knowledge of external elements of our counter-culture. they’re obviously very familiar with us, and are trying to create an audience by claiming they’re the real rebels and bomb throwers. trying to rip-off meme magic yet, their patreon is flush with cash (way out of proportion to their average plays, i.e. they have big money donors relative to our camp), their soundcloud and social media pages aren’t muzzled like ours, there’s nobody trying to silence them or shut them down. they can do stuff under their full names, yet mysteriously, their capitalist bosses won’t fire or black list them for calling for the death of capitalists. they get invited to do live performances in some of the jewiest, most “prestigious,” high rolling and trendy venues in nyc. unlike the daily stormer, the right stuff or ricky vaughn (who they constantly reference with typical seattle bourgeois shit-lib snark), they can say and do whatever they want because big capital and the american plutocracy is, at the very least, behind the core of their worldview (open borders, amalgamation of cultures and races, feminism). chapo trap house’s podcast is fairly new, yet already attracting positive attention from our elites. in their defense, they are critical of hillary clinton, yet establishment judeo-left individuals and institutions, from the hillary gun-runners at mediate to jeet heer, have commented quite positively on the show. compared to trs, they are getting quite a bit of very friendly publicity as a form of reaction to the rise of the alt-right. but this podcast has no natural audience. so who is it for? most of the blacks and browns who stand on top of the two white male goyim cis male’s in the progressive stack would sucker punch these private school kids who only know what niggers are in theory and steal their iphones if they had the chance. as for the obese feminists with magenta bowl cuts, they would curl-up into a ball and wail like banshees from all of the micro aggressions these three directly and indirectly engage in. the queers, pedos, trannies, and whatever other group of mentally ill perverts front and center as moral arbitrators of the modern judeo-left would distrust them for their pathology of enjoying sexual intercourse with women. last and not least, most leftists in the west today are humorless, moralistic mental midgets. the real purpose of cth is to staunch the bleeding of young and normal white males coming into our camp in droves right now. by using methods we have proven to resonate with this demographic, they hope to try and sell a state-sanctioned ideology whose only natural endpoint is basically the extermination of us and our families, but with an edgy veneer. this has been done in a different form in the past, it is similar to what the sony contracted, mtv promoted millionaires in rage against the machine did in the 90’s: plastic revolution in the name of art that isn’t actually revolutionary. i , eric striker, am calling out chapo trap house to have an unedited debate and exchange of ideas with me on their show. guys on our side are always interviewing and inviting leftists on our programs and websites, if they have faith in their ideas let’s see them put their parents’ money where their mouth is. the judeo-left fears free and open discourse due to the inherent weakness of their philosophy. let’s convince them: seeksearchdestoryyou know, outside of any morality arguments, it seems to me that asking soldiers to give you money after you ask them to get shot at by other people for the privilege of getting shot at in the first place, doesn't seem like a good idea somehow. is dc vaguely aware what happens to countries that gyp their troops on a regular basis? or have they watched so much star trek in the break room over the years that they've forgotten that problems are not solved peacefully in 60 minutes, or that we have not become a cashless society yet? the

a john pilger special [released late yesterday] courtesy of dartmouth films. here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of clinton emails leaked by wikileaks this year.” ld : despite the enormous populist support for trump and the extraordinary loathing in which hillary clinton is held by millions of american, assange says that “trump cannot be allowed to win.” trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by hillary clinton on similar occasions. recent news reports reveal that “election related violence is increasing and right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if mrs clinton ‘steals’ the election, as they fear will happen.” if hillary clinton wins this election, as assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across america. violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. hillary clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the white house. [ld] john pilger (left) conducted the 25-minute interview at the ecuadorian embassy where assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the us. here is a transcript of the interview followed by the youtube interview itself. click to enlarge the secret world of the us election john pilger: what’s the significance of the fbi’s intervention in these last days of the u.s. election campaign, in the case against hillary clinton? julian assange: if you look at the history of the fbi, it has become effectively america’s political police. the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia general david petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. almost no-one is untouchable. the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbi’s investigation, so there’s anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak. we’ve published about 33,000 of clinton’s emails when she was secretary of state. they come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] clinton has kept about half — 30,000 — to herself, and we’ve published about half. then there are the podesta emails we’ve been publishing. john podesta is hillary clinton’s primary campaign manager, so there’s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. these emails are combined with the cover up of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases. ‘russian government not the source of clinton leaks’ pilger : the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this, that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails. assange : the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-mccarthy hysteria: that russia is responsible for everything. hilary clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen u.s. intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications. that is false; we can say that the russian government is not the source. ‘saudi arabia & qatar funding isis and clinton’ pilger : the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. i’m thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque. assange : and twelve million dollars from morocco … pilger : twelve million from morocco, yeah. assange : for hillary clinton to attend a party. pilger : in terms of the foreign policy of the united states, that’s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of isil, in the middle east. can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil, are actually those who have helped create it. assange : there’s an early 2014 email from hillary clinton, not so long after she left the state department, to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar. now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation. even the u.s. government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil, or isis. but the dodge has always been that, well it’s just some rogue princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. but that email says that no, it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis. pilger : the saudis, the qataris, the moroccans, the bahrainis, particularly the saudis and the qataris, are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to saudi arabia. assange : under hillary clinton, the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia, worth more than $80 billion. in fact, during her tenure as secretary of state, total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value, doubled. pilger : of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation. assange : yes. pilger : that’s extraordinary. ‘clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition’ assange : i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network? she’s a centralising cog. you’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street, and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis. she’s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. she’s the smooth central representation of all that, and ‘all that’ is more or less what is in power now in the united states. it’s what we call the establishment or the dc consensus. one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from city bank. this is quite amazing. pilger : didn’t citybank supply a list… ? assange : yes. pilger : which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet? assange : yes. pilger : so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states? assange : if you were following the obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. so i think you can’t properly understand hillary clinton’s foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia. the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate. ‘libya is hillary clinton’s war’ pilger : why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya? can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us – told you – about what happened there? because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria: the isil, jihadism, and so on. and it was almost hillary clinton’s invasion. what do the emails tell us about that? assange : libya, more than anyone else’s war, was hillary clinton’s war. barak obama initially opposed it. who was the person championing it? hillary clinton. that’s documented throughout her emails. she had put her favoured agent, sidney blumenthal, on to that; there’s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand hillary clinton emails that we’ve published, just about libya. it’s not that libya has cheap oil. she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state — something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for president. so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton, and it’s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within libya; jihadists moved in, isis moved in, leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis. not only did you have people fleeing libya, people fleeing syria, the destabilisation of other african countries as a result of arms flows, but the libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa. so all problems, economic problems and civil war in africa — previously people fleeing those problems didn’t end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean. that was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by gaddafi: ‘what do these europeans think they’re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state? there’s going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe, and this is exactly what happened. ‘trump won’t be permitted to win’ pilger : you get complaints from people saying, ‘what is wikileaks doing? are they trying to put trump in the white house?’ assange : my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win. why do i say that? because he’s had every establishment off side; trump doesn’t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies… big foreign money … are all united behind hillary clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. pilger : there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians. some people say, ‘well, why doesn’t wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia?’ assange : we have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia. most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia, most of which are critical. our russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia, which they use our documents to back up. pilger : do you yourself take a view of the u.s. election? do you have a preference for clinton or trump? assange : let’s talk about donald trump. what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind? he represents american white trash, which hillary clinton called ‘deplorable and irredeemable’. it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. because he so clearly — through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies — represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way, including any criticism of hillary clinton. if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. ‘us attempting to squeeze wikileaks through my refugee status’ pilger : i’d like to talk about ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in london. now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we’re doing this interview, in the embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u.s. election campaign. can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuador’s support for you? assange : let’s let go back four years. i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy, because of the u.s. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, i was successful in my asylum application. the embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than £12.6 million. they admitted that over a year ago. now there’s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds — so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the united kingdom, and the americans who have been helping on the side. so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do. now we have the u.s. election campaign, the ecuadorian election is in february next year, and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador; we publish from france, we publish from, from germany, we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. it means that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election. pilger : tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. assange : i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately to the united states or to sweden. in sweden i am not charged, i have already been previously cleared by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne. we were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the united states we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u.s. has requested since at least 2000. so over the last fifteen years, every single person the u.s. has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won’t happen]. pilger : people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. assange : look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they’re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. they adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. so in my situation, frankly, i’m a bit institutionalised — this [the embassy] is the world … it’s visually the world for me. pilger : it’s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn’t it? assange : it’s the world without sunlight, but i haven’t seen sunlight in so long, i don’t remember it. pilger : yes. assange : so , yes, you adapt. the one real irritant is that my young children — they also adapt. they adapt to being without their father. that’s a hard, hard adaption which they didn’t ask for. pilger : do you worry about them? assange : yes, i worry about them; i worry about their mother. ‘i am innocent and in arbitrary detention’ pilger : some people would say, ‘well, why don’t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden?’ assange : the u.n. [the united nations working group on arbitrary detention] has looked into this whole situation. they spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. so it’s me and the u.n. verses sweden and the u.k. who’s right? the u.n. made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden, and that those countries must obey. it is an illegal abuse. it is the united nations formally asking, ‘what’s going on here? what is your legal explanation for this? assange says that you should recognise his asylum.’ and here is. sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say, ‘no, we’re not going to recognise the un ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesn’t suit the western establishment narrative — that yes, the west has political prisoners, it’s a reality, it’s not just me, there’s a bunch of other people as well. the west has political prisoners. of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. they don’t call them political prisoners in china, they don’t call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they don’t call them political prisoners in the united states, u.k. or sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. assange : here we have a case, the swedish case, where i have never been charged with a crime, where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum. those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? pilger : yes, it’s different. assange : the rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. the rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the u.n. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, i am subject to persecution by the united states. the beautiful prehistoric world: is earth now a wasteland? editorby pao chang earth is a beautiful blue planet that has gone through many changes. some people believed that earth used to be a world filled with mythical creatures and magic. others believed it used to have a landscape that is more beautiful than the picture below. the following two videos reveal some very interesting information about what earth may look like tens of thousands of years ago or possibly hundreds of thousands of years ago. did earth use to have trees as large as small mountains? are there actually no forests on earth? is earth now a wasteland? the videos below might have clues to help answer these questions. watch the videos and come up with your own conclusions. the prehistoric world exposed – ancient structures that will blow your mind!! there are no forests on earth!

(photo by irna) iranian parliament speaker ali larijani says the european union can play a significant role in the settlement of the syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting finnish president sauli niinistö in tehran on wednesday. he said that iran supports political solutions to crises in the middle east, including the conflict in syria, while some extra-regional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. the top iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. “unfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism” have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, larijani said. he also blamed the “extremist and deviated” ideology of wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither sunnis nor shias support terrorist or extremist acts. elsewhere in his remarks, larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between tehran and helsinki. the finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and iran. he also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in afghanistan, iraq and syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts. ‘terrorists pose threat to their own countries’ also on wednesday, the finnish president met with chairman of iran's expediency council ayatollah akbar hashemi rafsanjani to discuss bilateral ties and regional developments. chairman of iran's expediency council ayatollah akbar hashemi rafsanjani (r) meets with finnish president sauli niinistö (l) in tehran on october 26, 2016.

called on the international community to take measures to address the issue. the senior iranian official also raised the alarm over the issue of “state terrorism” pursued by the zionists. earlier in the day, finland’s president also met and held talks with iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif on the developments in the middle east and the promotion of bilateral ties in different sectors, including economic and banking cooperation. niinistö arrived in tehran on tuesday to hold talks with iranian officials on a range of issues. he also met with iranian president hassan rouhani on

that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of ‘classified information’ found on sex cheat anthony weiner’s (newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin) computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the nov 8th election, or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors? it seems that washington’s political tricksters have already sprung into action… after comey’s shock announcement, a “leaked” memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to fox news , in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. elite circles: fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton. certainly, a desperate democratic party, and an even more desperate obama white house (over the last 3 weeks, obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump. aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal, yesterday’s fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios: protect the president, who is already deeply tied to the clinton email cover-up democratic party machine has created a distraction to cover-up latest wikileaks dump. fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons. create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week. note: despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, you’d think hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election – if they have anything at all. it’s just too early to tell. see also: fbi james comey was board member of hsbc – clinton foundation & drug cartel ‘bank of choice’ the fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation – allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election – despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was “extremely careless,” and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state. zero hedge adds: “now, it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi, although comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. needless to say, all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats’ trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.” here is “leaked” (aka ‘just covering my ass) memo from fbi

monsanto tribunal happened from october 14th through 16th in the hague, netherlands. the people’s assembly was a parallel event, where farmers, consumer movements, and their associated networks discussed how we can feed the world in a safe way. both events are now over, so what happens now? read the article below to find out. read: monsanto “crimes against humanity” tribunal officially begins october 14th in hague netherlands the hearings of the monsanto tribunal were very impressive, and so was the people’s assembly. during the last two days of the event, the world watched witnesses’ testimonies, lawyers’ pleas, and the first impressions of the judges. at the tribunal, 750 people participated in the hague representing 30 nationalities from all over the world, thousands of people followed online on the livestream and social media, and the tribunal received a lot of press attention. both victims and experts thanked us for giving them a voice on this important international platform — and a very well documented voice in this new process to hold corporations accountable for their acts. the chairwoman of the tribunal, judge tulkens, expressed the importance of the tribunal in an interview with the french newspaper, le monde: the questions of the access to water and to healthy food are old. those are not new issues coming out of the mind of angry activists. those issues, just like the right to a healthy environment are likely to become more important with climate change. it is our duty to set legal tools to face those issues. the monsanto tribunal is a step and a tool within this dynamic.” the tribunal received quite a lot of media coverage. from french and german tv news programs to many newspapers and radio programs in various countries. see the links on our social media platforms (and later on the website). did monsanto attend the tribunal? monsanto was invited to the tribunal, but decided not to appear for their defense. we did get their attention though. they issued a statement in 5 languages saying that we are ‘pushing’ the wrong issues, since the real discussion is about feeding the world. monsanto fails to see feeding the world in a safe way was exactly the topic of the tribunal and of the discussion farmers, consumer movements, and their associated networks had in the parallel people’s assembly. many eminent speakers stressed that monsanto and agribusiness giants like them do not feed the world. rather, they are involved in producing commodities, feed for animals, fuel for cars, and sugar for the food industry at a very high cost for human health and environment. this is production that feeds profit, not people. it’s the small- and medium-scale farmers that are actually feeding the world. what is the purpose of the monsanto tribunal and the people’s assembly? this tribunal and people’s assembly are about showing the tremendous costs of industrial farming for humans, for health, and for nature . they are also about standing up to monsanto and their likes, and stopping them from poisoning our world and controlling our food supply. one way to do this is by showing the true cost of the current global food system, and the very real alternatives that exist. nnimmo bassey at the opening said : being an ambassador to this tribunal is like being an ambassador to mother earth. if mother earth could speak, monsanto ought to be in jail long before now. food is a celebration, it is culture, it is life. this is a struggle not against one multinational corporation, it is a struggle for life, it is a struggle for liberty. a struggle to stop big companies from colonizing our food systems, colonizing our agriculture, holding mother earth as a slave for their profits.” if you want, you can follow the monsanto tribunal on facebook , where many pictures and videos have already been posted. you can also see them if you have no facebook yourself. in the coming weeks, we will continue to release short interviews of the witnesses, experts and lawyers, as well as the speakers in the people’s assembly. we will also add all of this to our website , including all the hearings of the tribunal and the written testimonies in different languages. please be patient, we will keep you informed! what happens now that the tribunal is over? the judges are now thoroughly reviewing the evidence from legal briefs and witness testimonies to answer the six questions posed in the tribunal’s terms of reference. they will then present a legal advisory opinion, hopefully soon but if necessary next spring: we will supply logistic support, but the timing is up to them. as judge tulkens said: we will try to deliver the legal opinion before december 10th, the international day of human rights. it will be addressed to monsanto and to the united nations. from this legal opinion, other jurisdictions can be involved and more judges will step in. we, as the judges [at the monsanto tribunal]have seen, heard, noted and deliberated. chances are that the international law will take into consideration new issues such as the ones related to ecocide.” what you can do to help we would like to thank you and all the volunteers for your amazing support. this would not have been possible without you. stay tuned, follow us on social media, show your support and share messages wherever and whenever you can. ask friends to sign their support . together we will put an end to the era of poisoning and exploiting the world and move onward to a system where we work with nature instead of waging a war against it. note: image from the monsanto tribunal. originally published on the monsanto tribunal website . via: food revolution h/t stillness in the storm the shame, the heartbreak-

wail of sound cannons aimed at the protectors, there was tear gas. there were rubber bullets being fired into the crowd.and in my mind- this is not my america (but it is) this is not my america (but

emitted by trumpkins | libertarian beforeitsnews.com(before it's news) (don boudreaux) tweet here’s a letter to the wall street journal : wilbur ross’s and peter navarro’s defense of donald trump’s economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum (“ a vote for trump is a vote for growth ,” oct. 26). consider this claim: “donald trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation … and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports….” cut taxes? bunk. trump famously promises to raise taxes on americans who buy imports. reduce regulation? rubbish. trump promises more government intrusions into americans’ commerce with foreigners. as for ‘eliminating’ our trade deficit, trump might indeed succeed on that front. but such ‘success’ would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the american economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (ross and navarro seem to be unaware that to “eliminate our trade deficit” – such as was done, for example, during the great depression – is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of america’s capital stock.) but trump’s most absurd promise is to enrich americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return – a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired. but the trump camp’s confusion runs even more deeply. exporting for americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. so a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people’s spending power and to decrease it. it’s a policy meant to give americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips americans of the freedom to use those means. it’s the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle. sincerely, donald j. boudreaux professor of economics and martha and nelson getchell chair for the study of free market capitalism at the mercatus center george mason

as u.n. secretary general next year, told a conference in his native lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in europe this year. he said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. 22, 2016 the incoming head of the united nations warned on tuesday that ‘losers of globalization’ in rich countries have felt ignored by establishment politicians, prompting them to turn to nationalist agendas, as in the u.s. election and brexit referendum. “therefore wait ye upon me, saith the lord, until the day that i rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that i may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” zephaniah 3:8 (kjv) editor’s note: the bible clearly says that god’s desire is to “gather all the nations of the world together”, in order to “pour his fury” upon them. the united nations, something unique in world history, has been created by the will of god, and things are going to end exactly how the bible says they will end. all muslims will be driven out of israel as prophesied in zechariah 14:21 (kjv), israel will expand its borders to cover the size of the original land grant to abraham , and jesus will rule the world from jerusalem . and that will be the “new” world order. antonio guterres, elected in october to take over as u.n. secretary general next year , told a conference in his native lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in europe this year. he said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. antonio guterres formally elected as un chief: europe has struggled to handle a huge influx of refugees, many of whom displaced by the war in syria. the united states has accepted only a very small number of refugees and may take in even fewer next year. “in 2016, we have witnessed a dramatic deterioration of that international protection regime (for refugees),” guterres said. “this example started in the developed world, it started essentially in europe, it is spreading now like a virus into other parts of the world.” guterres, who was u.n. high commissioner for refugees until last year, linked the growing resistance to accepting refugees to wider concerns about globalism. “i don’t think we can look strictly at the refugee issue, i think the problem is a broader problem,” he told the conference on europe’s refugee crisis. there was a consensus in the mid-1990s that globalization would benefit all, he said. “but a lot of people were left behind … in the developed world, (there are) those who have been losers in globalization,” he said. “the recent analysis of the rust belt in the united states, i think, is a clear demonstration of that, when we speak about the elections.” donald trump won this month’s election in the united states in part thanks to support from voters who have seen their jobs lost to countries with cheaper labor. “so globalization has not been as successful as we had hoped and lots of people became not only angry with it, but feeling that political establishments and international organizations are not paying attention, were not taking care (of them),” he said. this led to what he called “a kind of evolution” in which anti-establishment parties now tended to win elections and referendums tended to attract majorities against whatever was put to a vote. source share this article trump bollywood ad meant to sway indian american voters is an hilarious fail (video) t steelmangoogle pinterest digg linkedin reddit stumbleupon print delicious pocket tumblr add another group to the list of people who won’t be voting for donald trump. oh, a few of them might but after they see this ad for trump, i’m betting the majority will laugh and vote for hillary clinton. earlier in the month, trump attended a bollywood concert for charity. it was organized by the republican hindu coalition, a group that was founded by a rich indian-american named shalli kumar, who is looking to be the hindu sheldon adelson. the indian community is heavily democratic so good luck with that. trump came to the event, lit the diya — it’s doubtful that he had any idea what it was — and then spoke. he pandered told the attendees that “the indian and hindu community will have a true friend in the white house,” promising they will “defeat radical islamic terrorism.” this inspired kumar to make an ad which will be playing 20 times a day on indian-american channels. he refused to say how much it cost the campaign to buy that much time but we can guess that mr. kumar is helping foot the bill. he previously has given almost $1 million to a fundraising committee which benefited both trump and the rnc. there is a lot to laugh about in the ad, bt trump’s inability to pronounce hindi words takes teh cake. it is such an obvious bit of pandering, even for him. the ad starts with a wish for a happy diwali , a holiday i am certain trump is ignorant of. the cut to trump’s orange face is a bit jarring after the pretty lights and flowers. kumar wanted to draw a similarity between trump and indian prime minister narendra modi. the pm’s campaign had used a clever catchphrase which loosely translates to “this time a modi government.” kumar wanted trump to replace modi’s name with his own. in hindi, that is “ab ki baar trump sarkar.” don’t get ahead of me, now. in the ad, which uses footage of trumps speech at the charity concert, a 2008 photo of the hotel which was attacked by islamic militants in mumbai gives way to a picture of pm modi. then back to trump who tries to speak the short hindi phrase. it’s something one must see to believe. make sure you aren’t drinking anything as you may endanger your computer. “approved by donald trump?” well, i guess so. this ad is not just pandering, it is awful. i hope the indian american community laugh this off and then go vote against this man who only shows interest in their culture when it might get him votes. oh, and happy diwali! may the light burn away any bad times and welcome the good. featured image by kena betancur/getty images share this article! fbi finds previously unseen hillary clinton emails on weiner’s laptop zero hedge crushing the hope-filled “it’s just a backup of what they have already seen” narrative of a campaign clutching at straws to defend their candidate, and confirming fox news bret baier’s earlier reporting , cbs news reports that the fbi has found new, non-duplicate emails related to hilary clinton’s tenure as secretary of state on anthony weiner’s laptop . sources earlier described to fox news’ bret baier as an “avalanche of evidence…” and tonight we are getting further clarification, from us officials, as to what that evidence consists of (via cbs news) these emails, cbs news’ andres triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on secretary clinton’s private server. at this point, however, it remains to be seen whether these emails are significant to the fbi’s investigation into clinton. it is also not known how many relevant emails there are. this is a major problem for the surrogates, lawyers, life-long friends, and defenders of the status quo as it destroys the narrative that has been painted suggesting these emails found on weiner’s laptop are merely backups of what law enforcement officials have already seen (and found no intent in). but what is most intriguing is the question of whether the missing 33,000 ‘personal’ emails ‘deleted’ by bryan pagliano in the full knowledge of hillary clinton (according to wikileaks emails), are also on the estranged husband of clinton right-hand-lady huma abedin’s laptop. as federal law enforcement officials concluded to cbs news tonight : “these emails have never been seen before” fox’s bret baier summed up what happens next… “i

who was born near detroit. shim worked for iranian broadcaster press tv as a foreign correspondent covering wars, legitimate protests and fake uprisings in multiple countries. via anonhq she reported live from syria, iraq, turkey, and lebanon during the conflict since 2011, including in the critical region of daraa during the beginning of protests, which are misrepresented by american media as the reasons for the fake civil war. serena shim was killed two years ago on october 19, 2014, in turkey while reporting on the intense battle for the syrian border city of kobani which was the focus of international media attention. she was 29 when she died. scroll down for video below! the city of kobani, which has one of turkey’s major border crossings with syria, because it was under threat of being completely captured by the islamic state. the us was forced to respond because islamic state grew out of control and threatened the border stability of turkey, and it became the first major area bombed during the us campaign in syria. the us and turkey were also arguing over washington’s plan to arm kurdish fighters on the syrian side of the border and how to allow kurds from iraq to support the effort by crossing through turkey. on the day she was killed, the us began operations to airdrop weapons to the kurds. less than two days later, islamic state fighters released a video showing the capture of an american weapons cache airdropped near the city. the video received international media attention which led the pentagon to admit the weapons mistakenly reached isil terrorists. it is claimed she was killed in a car accident with a cement truck. however, physical details about the case raise questions about the official explanation by turkish officials. there are also conflicting stories about the timeline after her death and before the family received her body, which indicate actions by the government of turkey and possibly the united states. two days before her death, serena shim reported on live international television that turkish intelligence services were planning to arrest her for questioning on the suspicion her being a spy. the day after her death, us officials denied releasing any information it had about whether the us government was aware of turkey’s plans. state department officials told wtf news it would be december 2017 before a freedom of information act request could be completed for information on what actions were taken by them to assist her as a us citizen. serena shim conducted an undercover investigation in turkey and syria lasting multiple months during 2012 as she spoke fluent arabic. her report aired on press tv beginning in december 2012. the issues listed below are topics she reported on first or experienced in person before they were reported by major media outlets. us officials continue to hide her death and not a single major media outlet in america reported on her death at the time despite the fact that she was popular in america and the middle east. 1. hillary clinton’s emails prove the us state dept and white house knew saudi arabia and qatar are funding islamic state clinton admitted, in an email conversation from august 2014 obtained by wikileaks, that us allies saudi arabia and qatar were sending money and weapons to isil. august 2014 was the height of terror during islamic state’s rise, leading to the growing international media outrage which forced president obama to publicly announce the beginning of airstrikes against isil in syria on september 23, 2014. the free thought project “while this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region.” “the qataris and saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the sunni world and the consequences of serious u.s. pressure.” the business newspaper financial times reported that prince saud al-faisal admitted saudi arabia created and funded islamic state as a response to the us supporting shia powers in iraq. the ft also reported in 2013that qatar had already spent $3 billion on funding the opposition. america’s top military official general martin dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was asked “do you know any major arab ally that embraces isil?” by republican senator lindsay graham. “i know major arab allies who fund them,” replied dempsey. 2. the united states wanted the islamic state to grow, as proved by leaked intelligence documents the rapid growth of the islamic state was not an accident, and many observers of the conflict questioned the us commitment to fighting terrorism as they ignored the group’s rise. since the start of the armed conflict in 2011, united states officials including hillary clinton have publicly stated that their solution to stop the war is to replace syrian president bashar al-assad and other government leaders. the public policy of the united states has been to support what the us calls moderate opposition groups under the name free syrian army (fsa) with the goal of having them weaken the government forces. that strategy changed in mid-2012 as news reports confirmed these rebels were committing war crimes by killing civilians and executing soldiers. one of the largest factions al nusra was specifically identified as a terrorist group in december 2012. at the same time, the islamic state (known as al qaeda in iraq) was growing in syria and had become a dominant force by 2013. the islamic state grew in syria for almost two years before the us announced it would take military action in september 2014. the intelligence report was dated august 2012 confirms the us government would have known about this threat for two years. judicial watch “if the situation unravels, there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared salafist principality in eastern syria (hasaka and der zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the shia expansion (iraq and iran).”syria has been fought over for two separate gas pipeline projects, a pipeline from qatar rejected by assad for one from iran. the second pipeline is a russian plan to connect with turkey to deliver gas to europe; the deal was finalized less than two weeks ago. make netherlands great again! hahaha it's spreading worldwide! the european union times geert wilders is the founder and leader of the freedom party in the netherlands. wilders is a favorite to

cernovich book: the newt gingrich mindset: how to improve your life by shutting whore mouths pic.twitter.com/gjzho23w1c students at black college just got beaten and maced for protesting kkk’s david duke colin taylorcomments last night, louisiana senate candidates vying for disgraced senator david vitter’s empty seat took the stage at the historically black dillard university. among them was former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke, who is making yet another run for public office. the students at dillard rightfully came out to protest – but were met with shocking violence from the police. seventy or so students protested duke’s presence at their college. “they’re allowing a terrorist, a neo-nazi ku klux klan member to be secured in a building in which we paid thousands of dollars to attend annually,” said political science major brielle kennedy , who was arrested moments later. nobody was allowed in the building during the debate, but students tried to enter anyway to express their fury – and were met with pepper-spray and beatings from police, who arrested six students. “they sprayed us directly in the face with it. i was covered on my shirt, my arms, my face. they’re bodyslamming people, they pulled girls’ hair. they’re just acting like heathens” recounted student hannah galloway. the debate itself went off the rails almost immediately as david duke began complaining about “jews ,” saying that “there is a problem in america with a very strong, powerful tribal group that dominates our media, dominates our international banking.” he then went on to say that “[hillary clinton] should be getting the electric chair, being charged with treason.” what did the police and state board of elections expect would happen when they held a debate at a historically black school in the deep south and invited a deplorable white supremacist and prominent trump supporter to attend? the violence with which the police reacted evokes the violence that white police visited on black protesters during jim crow and the battle for african-american civil rights – and is a painful symbol of how little has changed in the past sixty years. the fact that david duke had the support to qualify for the ballot is evidence enough. the battle at unesco ari liebermanthe muslim bloc may have won the battle, but did israel win the war? october 28, 2016 ari lieberman by now it should be clear to all but the blindest (or rabidly disingenuous) that the united nations is an organization that has been co-opted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies. it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy. an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today's greatest purveyor of judeophobia, historical revisionism and conspiracy theories. this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational, scientific, and cultural organization (unesco) that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city. on april 12, the 58-member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly one-sided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount, judaism’s holiest site, as a “muslim holy site of worship.” to add insult to injury, the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was “planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries.” unsurprisingly, the resolution, which was submitted by seven muslim nations, passed by a wide margin with 33 votes in favor, six against and 17 abstentions. two nations were absent for the vote. france, sweden, slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution. that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory. france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the world’s despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble. but following the vote, a crack appeared in the façade of anti-israel invective so prevalent at the u.n. it appeared that france was having a case of buyer’s remorse. in an address to the french parliament, prime minister manuel valls termed the resolution “clumsy” and “unfortunate.” he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that “france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem. it would make no sense; it is absurd to deny this history.” france is one of europe’s strongest advocates for the palestinians. the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from valls’ statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support. instead of declaring victory and moving on, they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october. the october 13 resolution , sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution. it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish (and christian) nexus to the city. this time however, the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening. while the resolution passed, the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the 58-member body. of the 24 nations that voted in favor of the resolution (mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to 23), 14 were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth, nigeria, is 50 percent muslim, making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion. what was notable was the fact that this time around, the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence. other developing nations, like india, which had hitherto supported arab-sponsored drafts also abstained. israel’s behind-the-scenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends. following the resolution’s passage, the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals. mexico , asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion. mexico's secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his government’s changed position “reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem.” brazil soon followed suit echoing mexico’s position. in a statement, the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such one-sided resolutions. italy, which had abstained, went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future. prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were “incomprehensible, unacceptable and wrong.” he added that “to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness.” even unesco’s director-general, irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that “the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city.” she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion. on wednesday, the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unesco’s world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism. the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites. the 21-member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move, croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc. instead of the motion passing by consensus, the vote was 10 in favor, two opposed, eight abstentions and one nation absent. the two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines. of the 10 ayes, seven were muslim. it was a pyrrhic victory at best. given the large number of muslim countries represented at the u.n. and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel, it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed. but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals, gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and non-aligned support. israel has been effectively reaching out to the so-called non-aligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact. part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology, agriculture, energy, counter-terrorism, cyber warfare and arms. this outreach has translated to political dividends at the u.n. nevertheless, the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many u.n. member states. it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the u.n. to impose terms and dictates on israel. there have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council. the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation. the administration’s objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed anti-israel resolution, likely introduced by france, or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto. in addition to betraying long-standing commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition, the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant anti-semitism to have a say on israel’s fate, is beyond asinine. hopefully, the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right direction. what the clintons did to haiti nathan j. robinsontweet widget by nathan j. robinson bill and hillary clinton’s role in the “remaking” of haiti after a devastating earthquake and foreign occupation is “indefensible,” according to the author’s article, “superpredator: bill clinton’s use and abuse of black america,” from which this piece is excerpted. “many clinton projects “have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island’s ruling elite.” other projects simply fizzled. “the money donated and invested was extraordinary, but nobody seems to know where it has gone.” what the clintons did to haiti by nathan j. robinson this article previously appeared in global research and current affairs . “she intended to ‘make haiti the proving ground for her vision of american power.’” bill and hillary clinton had long shared a personal interest in haiti, dating back to the time of their honeymoon, part of which was spent in port-au-prince. in his autobiography, bill says that his understanding of god and human nature were profoundly transformed when they witnessed a voodoo ceremony in which a woman bit the head off a live chicken. hillary clinton says the two of them “fell in love” with haiti and they had developed a “deep connection” to the country. so when hillary clinton became secretary of state in 2009, she consciously made the redevelopment of haiti one of her top priorities. the country, she announced, would be a laboratory where the united states could “road-test new approaches to development,” taking advantage of what she termed “the power of proximity.” she intended to “make haiti the proving ground for her vision of american power.” hillary clinton selected her own chief of staff, cheryl mills, to run the haiti project. mills would be joined by bill clinton, who had been deputized by the u.n. as a “special envoy” to haiti. bill’s role was not well-defined, and haitians were curious about what was in store. mills wrote in an email to hillary clinton that haitians saw bill’s appointment as “a step toward putting haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status.” soon, “joking that he must be coming back to lead a new colonial regime,” the haitian media “ dubbed him le gouverneur.” the project was heavily focused on increasing haiti’s appeal to foreign corporations. as politico reported , clinton’s experiment “had business at its center: aid would be replaced by investment, the growth of which would in turn benefit the united states.” “clinton announced that haiti would be a laboratory where the united states could road-test new approaches to development, taking advantage of ‘the power of proximity.’” one of the first acts in the new “business-centered” haiti policy involved suppressing haiti’s minimum wage. a 2009 haitian law raised the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour, from 24 cents an hour previously. haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors for hanes and levi strauss, were furious, insisting that they were only willing to agree to a seven-cent increase. the manufacturers approached the u.s. state department, who brought intense pressure to bear against haitian president rené préval, working to “aggressively block” the 37-cent increase. the u.s. deputy mission chief said a minimum-wage increase “did not take economic reality into account” and simply “appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.” but as ryan chittum of the columbia journalism review explained , the proposed wage increase would have been only the most trivial additional expense for the american garment manufacturers: “as of last year hanes had 3,200 haitians making t-shirts for it. paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. hanesbrands incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers. or better yet, hanesbrands ceo richard noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. he could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.” “u.s. deputy mission chief said a minimum-wage increase ‘did not take economic reality into account” and simply ‘appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.’” the truth of the “economic reality” was that the haitian undergarment sector was hardly likely to become wildly less competitive as a result of the increase. the effort to suppress the minimum wage was not solely a clinton project. it was also a “concerted effort on the part of haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, u.s. politicians, economists, and american companies.” but it was in keeping with the state department’s priorities under clinton, which prioritized creating a favorable business climate. it was that same familiar clinton move “from aid to trade.” bill clinton’s program for haitian development, designed by oxford university economist paul collier, “ had garment exports at its center.” collier wrote that because of “propitious” factors like “poverty and [a] relatively unregulated labor market, haiti has labor costs that are fully competitive with china.” but the clintons’ role in haiti would soon expand even further. in 2010, the country was struck by the worst earthquake in its history. the disaster killed 160,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million more. (the consequences of the earthquake were exacerbated by the ruined state of the haitian food economy, plus the concentration of unemployed haitian farmers in port-au-prince.) bill clinton was soon put in charge of the u.s.-led recovery effort. he was appointed to head the interim haiti recovery commission (ihrc), which would oversee a wide range of rebuilding projects. at president obama’s request, clinton and george w. bush created the “clinton-bush haiti fund,” and began aggressively fundraising around the world to support haiti in the earthquake’s aftermath. (with hillary clinton as secretary of state overseeing the efforts of usaid, the clintons’ importance to the recovery could not be overstated; bill’s appointment meant that “at every stage of haiti’s reconstruction—fundraising, oversight and allocation—a clinton was now involved.” despite appearances, the clinton-bush fund was not focused on providing traditional relief. as they wrote , “[w]hile other organizations in haiti are using their resources to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, we are using our resources to focus on long-term development.” while the fund would advertise that “100% of donations go directly to relief efforts,” clinton and bush adopted an expansive definition of “relief” efforts, treating luring foreign investment and jobs as a crucial part of earthquake recovery. on their website, they spoke proudly of what the new york daily news characterized as a program of “supporting longterm programs to develop haiti’s business class.” “at every stage of haiti’s reconstruction—fundraising, oversight and allocation—a clinton was now involved.” the strategy was an odd one. port-au-prince had been reduced to ruin, and haitians were crowded into filthy tent cities, where many were dying of a cholera outbreak (which had itself been caused by the negligence of the united nations). whatever value building new garment factories may have had as a longterm economic plan, haitians were faced with somewhat more pressing concerns like the basic provision of shelter and medicine, as well as the clearing of the thousands of tons of rubble that filled their streets. the clinton-led recovery was a disaster. a year after the earthquake, a stinging report from oxfam singled out clinton’s ihrc as creating a “quagmire of indecision and delay” that had made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. oxfam found that: “…less than half of the reconstruction aid promised by international donors has been disbursed. and while some of that money has been put toward temporary housing, almost none of the funds have been used for rubble removal.” instead, the clinton foundation, ihrc, and state department created what a wall street journal writer called “a mishmash of low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments and half-finished projects.” haitian ihrc members lamented that the commission had produced “a disparate bunch of approved projects. . . [that] do not address as a whole either the emergency situation or the recovery, let alone the development, of haiti.” a 2013 investigation by the government accountability office found that most money for the recovery was not being dispersed, and that the projects that were being worked on were plagued by delays and cost overruns. many clinton projects were extravagant public relations affairs that quickly fizzled. for example, the washington post reported that : “…[a] 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the clinton foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.” “ a stinging report from oxfam singled out clinton’s ihrc as creating a ‘quagmire of indecision and delay.’” other clinton ventures were seen as “disconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the western hemisphere.” politico reported that many clinton projects “have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island’s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with.” for example, “the clinton bush haiti fund invested more than $2 million in the royal oasis hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 men’s dress shirts.” predictably, the royal oasis didn’t do an especially roaring trade; the washington post reported that “[o]ne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing.” in a country with a 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars in a luxury hotel was not just offensive, but economically daft. sometimes the recovery projects were accused not only of being pointless, but of being downright harmful. for instance, bill clinton had proudly announced that the clinton foundation would be funding the “construction of emergency storm shelters in léogâne.” but an investigation of the shelters that the foundation had actually built found that they were “shoddy and dangerous” and full of toxic mold. the nation discovered , among other things, that the temperature in the shelters reached over 100 degrees, causing children to experience headaches and eye irritations (which may have been compounded by the mold), and that the trailers showed high levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked to asthma and other lung diseases. the clinton foundation had subcontracted the building of the shelters to clayton homes, a firm that had already been sued in the united states by the federal emergency management administration (fema) for “having provided formaldehyde-laced trailers to hurricane katrina victims.” (clayton homes was owned by warren buffett ’s berkshire hathaway, and buffett had been a longstanding major donor to the clinton foundation.) the nation ’s investigation reported on children whose classes were being held in clinton foundation trailers. their semester had just been cut short, and the students sent home, because the temperature in the classrooms had grown unbearable. the misery of the students in the clinton trailers was described: “judith seide, a student in lubert’s sixth-grade class [explained that] she and her classmates regularly suffer from painful headaches in their new clinton foundation classroom. every day, she said, her ‘head hurts and i feel it spinning and have to stop moving, otherwise i’d fall.’ her vision goes dark, as is the case with her classmate judel, who sometimes can’t open his eyes because, said seide, ‘he’s allergic to the heat.’ their teacher regularly relocates the class outside into the shade of the trailer because the swelter inside is insufferable. sitting in the sixth-grade classroom, student mondialie cineas, who dreams of becoming a nurse, said that three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day. ‘at noon, the class gets so hot, kids get headaches,’ the 12-year-old said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow. she is worried because ‘the kids feel sick, can’t work, can’t advance to succeed.’” “three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day.” the most notorious post-earthquake development project, however, was the caracol industrial park . the park was pitched as a major job creator, part of the goal of helping haiti “build back better” than it was before. the state department touted the prospect of 100,000 new jobs for haitians, with hillary clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. the industrial park followed the clintons’ preexisting development model for haiti: public/private partnerships with a heavy emphasis on the garment industry. even though there were still hundreds of thousands of evacuees living in tents, the project was based on “the more expansive view that, in a desperately poor country where traditional foreign aid has chronically failed, fostering economic development is as important as replacing what fell down.” much of the planning was focused on trying to lure a south korean clothing manufacturer to set up shop there, by plying them with u.s. taxpayer funding. the caracol project was “the centerpiece” of the u.s.’s recovery effort. a gala celebrating its opening featured the clintons and sean penn, and it was treated as the emblem of the new, “better” haiti, that would demonstrate the country’s commitment to being “open for business.” in order to build the park, hundreds of poor farmers were evicted from their land, so that millions of dollars could be spent transforming it. but the project was a terrible disappointment. after four years, it was only operating at 10% capacity , and the jobs had failed to materialize : far from 100,000 jobs—or even the 60,000 promised within five years of the park’s opening— “caracol currently employs just 5,479 people full time. that comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far; or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average [caracol] worker makes per year. the park, built on the site of a former u.s. marine-run slave labor camp during the 1915-1934 u.s. occupation, has the best-paved roads and manicured sidewalks in the country, but most of the land remains vacant.” most of the seized farmland went unused, then, and even for the remaining farmers, “ surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.” huge queues of unemployed haitians stood daily in front of the factory, awaiting jobs that did not exist. the washington post described the scene: “each morning, crowds line up outside the park’s big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. they wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding résumés in envelopes. most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day. from his envelope, jean mito palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the u.s. agency for international development on an industrial sewing machine. ‘i have three kids and a wife, and i can’t support them,’ he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. ‘i have a diploma, but i still can’t get a job here. i still have nothing.’” “ the interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in haiti.” for some , the caracol project perfectly symbolized the clinton approach: big promises, an emphasis on sweatshops, incompetent management, and little concern for the actual impact on haitians. “caracol is a prime example of bad help,” as one haiti scholar put it . “the interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in haiti.” but, failure as it may have been, the caracol factory was among the more successful of the projects, insofar as it actually came into existence. a large amount of the money raised by bill clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the u.s. under hillary clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown. as politico explained : “even bill’s u.n. office of the special envoy couldn’t track where all of [it] went—and the truth is that still today no one really knows how much money was spent ‘rebuilding’ haiti. many initial pledges never materialized. a whopping $465 million of the relief money went through the pentagon, which spent it on deployment of u.s. troops—20,000 at the high water mark, many of whom never set foot on haitian soil. that money included fuel for ships and planes, helicopter repairs and inscrutables such as an $18,000 contract for a jungle gym… huge contracts were doled out to the usual array of major contractors, including a $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included agility public warehousing ksc, a kuwaiti firm that was supposed to have been blacklisted from doing business with washington after a 2009 indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the u.s. government during the iraq war.” the recovery under the clintons became notorious for its mismanagement. clinton staffers “ had no idea what haiti was like and had no sensitivity to the haitians.” they were reportedly rude and condescending toward haitians, even refusing to admit haitian government ministers to meetings about recovery plans. while the clintons called in high-profile consulting firms like mckinsey to draw up plans, they had little interest in listening to haitians themselves. the former haitian prime minister spoke of a “weak” american staff who were “more interested in supporting clinton than helping haiti.” “a large amount of the money raised by bill clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the u.s. under hillary clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.” one of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was chelsea clinton, who wrote a detailed email to her parents in which she said that while haitians were trying to help themselves, every part of the international aid effort, both governmental and nongovernmental, was falling short. “the incompetence is mind numbing,” she wrote . chelsea produced a detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps that needed to be taken in order to get the recovery on track. but the memo was kept within the clinton family, released only later under a freedom of information act disclosure of hillary’s state department correspondence. if it had come out at the time, as haiti journalist jonathan katz writes , it “would have obliterated the public narrative of helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors that her mother’s state department was working so hard to promote.” the clintons’ haiti recovery ended with a whimper. the clinton-bush haiti fund distributed the last of its funds in 2012 and disbanded, without any attempt at further fundraising. the ihrc “ quietly closed their doors” in october of 2011, even though little progress had been made. as the boston review ’s jake johnston explained , though hundreds of thousands remained displaced, the ihrc wiped its hands of the housing situation: “[l]ittle remained of the grand plans to build thousands of new homes. instead, those left homeless would be given a small, one-time rental subsidy of about $500. these subsidies, funded by a number of different aid agencies, were meant to give private companies the incentive to invest in building houses. as efforts to rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, the rental subsidies turned haitians into consumers, and the housing problem was handed over to the private sector.” the clintons themselves simply stopped speaking about haiti. after the first two years, they were “nowhere to be seen” there, despite hillary’s having promised that her commitment to haiti would long outlast her tenure as secretary of state. haiti has been given little attention during hillary clinton’s presidential campaign, even though the haiti project was ostensibly one of great pride for both clintons. “one of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was chelsea clinton.” the widespread consensus among observers is that the haiti recovery, which time called the u.s.’s “compassionate invasion,” was a catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. jonathan katz writes that “it’s hard to find anyone these days who looks back on the u.s.-led response to the january 12, 2010, haiti earthquake as a success.” while plenty of money was channeled into the country, it largely went to what were “little more than small pilot projects—a new set of basketball hoops and a model elementary school here, a functioning factory there.” the end result has been that little has changed for haiti. “haitians find themselves in a social and economic situation that is worse than before the earthquake,” reports a belgian photojournalist who has spent 10 years in haiti: “everyone says that they’re living in worse conditions than before… when you look at the history of humanitarian relief, there’s never been a situation when such a small country has been the target of such a massive influx of money and assistance in such a short span of time… on paper, with that much money in a territory the size of haiti, we should have witnessed miracles; there should have been results.” “if anything, they appear worse off,” says foreign policy of haiti’s farmers. “i really cannot understand how you could raise so much money, put a former u.s. president in charge, and get this outcome,” said one haitian official. indeed, the money donated and invested was extraordinary. but nobody seems to know where it has gone. haitians direct much of the blame toward the clintons. as a former haitian government official who worked on the recovery said , “[t]here is a lot of resentment about clinton here. people have not seen results. . .. they say that clinton used haiti.” haitians “ increasingly complain that clinton-backed projects have often helped the country’s elite and international business investors more than they have helped poor ‘haitians.” there is a “suspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in haiti than to help it.” and that while “striking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in haiti.” but perhaps we should be more forgiving of the clintons’ conduct during the haitian recovery. after all, instead of doing true harm, the clintons simply failed to do much good. and perhaps it’s better to have a luxury hotel than not to have one, better to have a few jobs than none at all. thanks to bill clinton, there’s a gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating at a fraction of its capacity. yet it’s a mistake to measure clinton against what would have happened if the united states had done nothing at all for haiti. the question is what would have happened if a capable, nonfamous administrator, rather than a globetrotting narcissist, had been placed in charge. tens of millions of dollars were donated toward the haiti recovery by people across the world; it was an incredible outpouring of generosity. the squandering of that money on half-baked development schemes (mainly led by cronies ), and the ignoring of haitians’ own demands, mean that clinton may have caused considerable harm through his failure. plenty of people died in tent cities that would not have died if the world’s donations had been used effectively. “defending the clintons’ haiti record is an impossible endeavor.” democrats have bristled at recent attempts by donald trump to criticize hillary clinton over her record in haiti. jonathan katz, whose in-depth reporting from haiti was stingingly critical of the clintons, has now changed his tune , insisting that we all bear the responsibility for the failed recovery effort. when trump accused the clintons of squandering millions building “a sweatshop” in haiti in the form of the caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted he was spewing pinocchios. the washington post said that while clinton foundation donors may have financially benefited from the factory-building project, they benefited “writ large” rather than “directly.” the post cited the words of the factory’s spokesman as evidence that the factory was not a sweatshop, and pointed out that caracol workers earned at least “minimum wage” (failing to mention that minimum wage in haiti remains well under a dollar). politifact also rated the sweatshop claim “mostly false,” even though katz notes “long hours, tough conditions, and low pay” at the factory and politifact acknowledges the “ongoing theft of legally-earned wages.” defending the clintons’ haiti record is an impossible endeavor, one democrats should probably not bother attempting. as the center for economic and policy research, which has studied the recovery, noted , when it comes to the clinton-led recovery mission, “it’s hard to say it’s been anything other than a failure.” haitians are not delusional in their resentment of the clintons; they have good reason to feel as if they were used for publicity, and discarded by the clintons when they became inconvenient. none of this means that one should vote for donald trump for president. his tears for haiti are those of a highly opportunistic crocodile, and his interest in the country’s wellbeing began at the precise moment that it could be used a bludgeon with which to beat his political opponent. as we have previously noted in this publication , one does not need to be convinced that hillary clinton is an honorable person in order to be convinced that she is the preferable candidate. it is important, however, not to maintain any illusions, not to stifle or massage the truth in the service of short-term electoral concerns. it remains simultaneously true that a clinton presidency is our present least-worst option and that what the clintons did to haiti was callous, selfish, and indefensible. the top 10 places in the world you're not allowed to visit dikran arakelian (noreply@blogger.com)think the world is your oyster? think again! from top secret hq's to secretive underground train networks – we run through the top 10 places you won't be entering anytime soon for love nor money. 10. bohemian grove like something out of a cult thriller film, bohemian grove is a 2,700 acre rural location somewhere in monte rio, california. the land is owned by private san-fran based arts club known – surprisingly – as the bohemian club. every summer, the club host a two-week, three weekend camp in the woods for the most powerful men in the world. it all looks a bit weird. 9. vatican secret archive this isn't just any old library, this is a vatican library! only a sacred few have access to the vaults – but feat not, if you need to read one of the books (which by the way are owned by the pope) you can receive the manuscript via email – how very modern! 8. lascaux caves – france found in south west france, lascaux is complex of caves that are world-renowned for its palaeolithic cave paintings that are estimated to be over 17,500 years old. although these caves were once open to the public, they have since been closed to preserve the original artwork. 7. pine gap – australia known as australia's equivalent of area 51. located in central australia, and run the by the government and the cia, it's the only place in the land down under designated as a no fly zone and is used as a monitoring station. what they're monitoring, we don't know. but according to recent news, pine gap operate a number of drone strike programmes. 6. moscow metro-2 metro-2 is a secret underground tube system which runs parallel with the public metro system in moscow. the system was built during the reign of stalin and was code-named, d-6 by the russian intelligence organisation – the kgb. when quizzed on this secret underground system, the federal security service of the russian federation (fsb) would not confirm or deny its existence. it's rumoured that the underground system dwarfs the public metro with 4 lines that run between 50-200m deep allowing the kremlin to connect directly with fsb hq, the government airport and an underground town at ramenki. 5. room 39 north korea based in north korea, room 39, also known as bureau 39 is a secretive organisation thats sole purpose is to find ways to obtain foreign currency for kim jong-un. established in 1970, the organisation has been described as the kingpin of north korea's so-called, ‘court economy’. although very little has been published on room 39, it's believed that the organisation has over 20 bank accounts in switzerland and china and are used solely for the purpose of money laundering and other illegal transactions. it has also been reported that the organisation is involved in drug smuggling and illicit weapon sales. what is known, is that the secretive group have over 130 trading companies under its jurisdiction which are controlled by kim jong-un. if you ever fancy popping over to north korean and attempting to enter the organisations hq, you need to head towards the workers party building in pyongyang. 4. mezghorye, russia this place has been reported as russia's secret nuclear missile site. there are two battalions permanently stationed here to ward off visitors. the base contains automatic ballistic missiles which can be remotely activated in the event of a nuclear strike which is detected by seismic, light and pressure sensors. 3. disney club 33 exclusive club located at disneyland, florida, this fairly unobtrusive looking front door is actually the entrance to a highly exclusive members only club. how do i get in? i hear you cry. well firstly, you need to locate it. without giving too much away, head to new orleans square and look for the blue bayou. getting in won't be as easy – the club is not open to the public. however, members, which include presidents of the united states, business leaders and actors – can bring friends and associates along, so you better start networking! 2. area 51 probably the worst kept secret, area 51 is the alias for a military base that is located in nevada – around 80 miles north-west of downtown las vegas. in the centre of the base is a large military airfield. according to insiders, the base's main purpose is research and development of experimental aircrafts and weaponry. what's bizarre is that the u.s government doesn't acknowledge it's existence – adding fuel to conspiracy theories that the base is used for analysis of ufo's and aliens or is that what they want you to think? 1. google data center home of big brother. this is as heavily guarded as area

are mounting as the most viciously divisive election in our nation’s history draws closer, and it is truly bringing out the worst in the american people. an african-american church in mississippi, the hopewell m.b. church in greeneville , has been set ablaze, causing heavy damage to the building – and in case there was any mystery as to who was responsible, “vote trump” was spray-painted on the side. for all their talk about “religious freedom,” conservative trump fans sure does have a fondness for attacking religious institutions. mosques have been torched around the country in response to terrorist attacks , collectively punishing members of an entire religion for crimes committed by mentally disturbed individuals. black churches have also been torched throughout the south as white supremacists and neo-nazis come out of the wood-work, emboldened by trump’s racial dogwhistles and ethno-nationalist rabble-rousing. the worst of these targeted attacks came last summer when a white supremacist walked into the emanuel ame church in charleston, s.c, and murdered nine peaceful worshippers. this is the second act of domestic terrorism committed in the united states today, coming just hours before a white man murdered two police officers in iowa, and as trump continues to rile up his base and perpetuate the delusions of a conspiracy against him, it’s not likely to be the last.

standing rock dan nanamkin during the treaty camp’s confrontation with militarized police force on thursday afternoon. photo by adam alexander johansson. by kelly hayes / yesmagazine.org this piece is very personal because, as an indigenous woman, my analysis is very personal, as is the analysis that my friends on the frontlines have shared with me. we obviously can’t speak for everyone involved, as native beliefs and perspectives are as diverse as the convictions of any people. but as my friends hold strong on the frontlines of standing rock, and i watch transfixed with both pride and worry, we feel the need to say a few things. i’ve been in and out of communication with my friends at standing rock all day. as you might imagine, as much as they don’t want me to worry, it’s pretty hard for them to stay in touch. i asked if there was anything they wanted me to convey on social media, as most of them are maintaining a very limited presence on such platforms. the following is my best effort to summarize what they had to say, and to chime in with a few corresponding thoughts of my own. it is crucial that people recognize that standing rock is part of an ongoing struggle against colonial violence. #nodapl is a front of struggle in a long-erased war against native peoples — a war that has been active since first contact, and waged without interruption. our efforts to survive the conditions of this anti-native society have gone largely unnoticed because white supremacy is the law of the land, and because we, as native people, have been pushed beyond the limits of public consciousness. the fact that we are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than any other group speaks to the fact that native erasure is ubiquitous, both culturally and literally, but pushed from public view. our struggles intersect with numerous others, but are perpetrated with different motives and intentions. anti-blackness, for example, is a performative enforcement of structural power, whereas the violence against us is a matter of pragmatism. the struggle at standing rock is an effort to prevent the construction of a deadly, destructive mechanism, created by greed-driven people with no regard for our lives. it has always been this way. we die, and have died, for the sake of expansion and white wealth, and for the maintenance of both. the harms committed against us have long been relegated to the history books. this erasure has occurred for the sake of both white supremacy and us mythology, such as american exceptionalism. it has also been perpetuated to sustain the comfort of those who benefit from harms committed against us. our struggles have been kept both out of sight and out of mind — easily forgotten by those who aren’t directly impacted. it should be clear to everyone that we are not simply here in those rare moments when others bear witness. to reiterate (what should be obvious): we are not simply here when you see us. we have always been here, fighting for our lives, surviving colonization, and that reality is rarely acknowledged. even people who believe in freedom frequently overlook our issues, as well as the intersections of their issues with our own. it matters that more of the world is bearing witness in this historic moment, but we feel the need to point out that the dialogue around #nodapl has become extremely climate oriented. yes, there is an undeniable connectivity between this front of struggle and the larger fight to combat climate change. we fully recognize that all of humanity is at risk of extinction, whether they realize it or not. but intersectionality does not mean focusing exclusively on the intersections of our respective work. it sometimes means taking a journey well outside the bounds of those intersections. in discussing #nodapl, too few people have started from a place of naming that we have a right to defend our water and our lives, simply because we have a natural right to defend ourselves and our communities. when “climate justice”, in a very broad sense, becomes the center of conversation, our fronts of struggle are often reduced to a staging ground for the messaging of ngos. this is happening far too frequently in public discussion of #nodapl. yes, everyone should be talking about climate change, but you should also be talking about the fact that native communities deserve to survive, because our lives are worth defending in their own right — not simply because “this affects us all.” so when you talk about standing rock, please begin by acknowledging that this pipeline was redirected from an area where it was most likely to impact white people. and please remind people that our people are struggling to survive the violence of colonization on many fronts, and that people shouldn’t simply engage with or retweet such stories when they see a concrete connection to their own issues — or a jumping off point to discuss their own issues. our friends, allies and accomplices should be fighting alongside us because they value our humanity and right to live, in addition to whatever else they believe in. every native at standing rock — every native on this continent — has survived the genocide of a hundred million of our people. that means that every indigenous child born is a victory against colonialism, but we are all born into a fight for our very existence. we need that to be named and centered, which is a courtesy we are rarely afforded. this message is not a condemnation. it’s an ask. we are asking that you help ensure that dialogue around this issue begins with and centers a discussion of anti-native violence and policies, no matter what other connections you might ultimately make, because those discussions simply don’t happen in this country. there obviously aren’t enough people talking about climate change, but there are even fewer people — and let’s be real, far fewer people — discussing the various forms of violence we are up against, and acting in solidarity with us. and while such discussions have always been deserved, we are living in a moment when native water protectors and water warriors have more than earned both acknowledgement and solidarity. so if you have been with us in this fight, we appreciate you. but we are reaching out, right now, in these brave days for our people, and asking that you keep the aforementioned truths front and center as you discuss this effort. this moment is, first and foremost, about native liberation, self determination and native survival. that needs to be centered and celebrated. thanks, k and friends kelly hayes is a direct action trainer and a co-founder of the chicago light brigade and the direct action collective lifted voices. she blogs at

supporters. it is conceptually difficult for many of us to understand how anyone could support trump knowing all we know about him. but many people don’t know what we know, so here’s a viral list that every trump supporter needs to read before they vote on tuesday, courtesy of some anonymous facebook poster. so you want someone to ‘tell it like it is’? ok, here you go. 1. you join a lying machine and call hillary crooked. but you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. you support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. you support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. just like we now know putin’s puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. a corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with putin’s girlfriend. making russia great again? a con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. you say you love our veterans but support a man who believes pows are not heroes because they were captured? a man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. a man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to afghanistan. a man who insults and derides our generals. 3. you think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. a man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after orlando mass shooting & when dwyane wade’s cousin nykea aldridge was killed. as 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in manhattan just hours after the attack. when the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit eu, he boasted about making money off british economic uncertainty. when the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of americans lost their homes, he said “ i ‘sort of hope’ real estate market tanks.” trump is always looking out for trump. how do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? he is not even a good person. 4. you say you’re patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution’s limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. a careless small man who asked russia to spy on our former secretary of state. a man who trash talks our nato allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like saddam hussein, kim jong un, muammar gaddafi, vladimir putin…etc 5. you support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. a man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire jeffrey epstein. a man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. then you turn around and bring up bill clinton’s history with women? i agree with you 100% bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. may i remind you bill is not running to be the next president. if you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can’t ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. you support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? a man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. yes, hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. you call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? every time trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. fact checkers have proven it over and over again. we are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in new jersey on 9/11. the man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional. 8. you support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. he is a man capable of solving our immigration problem? 9. i agree 100% if she’s elected hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the clinton foundation. let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. with that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the clinton foundation. the irs found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to florida attorney general pam bondi. just after 4 days of the bribe payment pam dropped trump u case. he also held $150k fundraiser for pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. his foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to the giving back fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. a man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. a man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. you claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in bangladesh, china, honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? you claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home? 11. you claim the unfit, unstable putin’s little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right’s anti-muslim and anti-immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country? 12. you support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said “obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. then he pretends he cares about the black communities. he brings up hillary’s reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as “super-predators” in 1996? i don’t agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. something trump refuses to do. of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don’t care what he says or does. you are using your hatred to cloud your judgement. comment on this powerful corporate lobby is quietly backing hillary — and nobody’s talking about it by runsinquicksand runsinquicksandcarey wedler | antimedia over the course of the 2016 presidential election, americans who rail against hillary clinton have condemned the media’s bias in her favor — and rightfully so. clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media — whose parent companies often donate to her — with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. but as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind hillary clinton – and hardly anyone is talking about it. though outrage over clinton’s corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like goldman sachs , citibank, jp morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks. when people think of hollywood’s support for a political campaign, their minds tend to focus on the entertainment industry’s most visible figures — celebrities. from george clooney , katy perry, and leonardo dicaprio to justin timberlake, reese witherspoon, steven spielberg, beyonce, and jay-z, the celebrity consensus this year has settled on clinton. but underneath the stars’ ‘progressive’ choice is an intentional, systematic machine working in hillary’s favor, and it mirrors other conglomerated industries that have aligned behind her. moguls with millions (and billions) back hillary and the clinton family the first layer of clinton’s corporate hollywood allegiance is rather simple to peel back, simply because hillary’s top industry donors make no secret of their support. earlier this year, george clooney held a $100,000-a-plate fundraiser for clinton, one that earned $15 million dollars — far more than goldman sachs has collectively donated to her campaign. the actor’s event raised money for the hillary victory fund, which was recently revealed to be an avenue for maxed out donors to contribute more than the allowable amount. the victory fund has also been criticized for hoarding money for hillary that was supposed to go to state democratic parties. clooney teamed up with one of corporate hollywood’s most powerful executives, jeffrey katzenberg, for this fundraiser. katzenberg rose to prominence at walt disney in the 1990s, where he helmed some of the millennial generation’s favorite childhood films: beauty and the beast , aladdin , the lion king , and the little mermaid were all products of katzenberg’s leadership. several years later, he partnered with steven spielberg (also a longtime clinton supporter) and david geffen, a music mogul, to create dreamworks animation. katzenberg was the top bundler for barack obama in 2012 and also funded him in 2008, so it’s unsurprising the president takes his phone calls. further, katzenberg’s right-hand man, andy spahn, visited the white house almost 50 times during obama’s first term, mother jones reported at the time, enjoying a close relationship with the president — and some economic benefits. katzenberg, who recently earned $391 million on the sale of dreamworks to comcast, has donated at least $1 million to clinton’s campaign this election season. then there’s billionaire haim saban, the staunchly pro-israel entertainment mogul behind the original power rangers series. he is clinton’s top individual donor, besting katzenberg, with at least $6.4 million in donations to her campaign. he has contributed $15 million to the clinton foundation, and his wife, cheryl, serves on the board. saban has supported the clintons since the 1990s, and during bill’s time in office, he enjoyed the business perks of being friends with the president of the united states, as mother jones has detailed . his investments are tied to wall street, and he has also enjoyed clinton’s condemnation of boycott, sanction, divest, a nonviolent, market-based global protest movement challenging israel’s occupation of palestine. both men, therefore, know well the perks of having friends in high places — and both are some of the top donors of any candidate in the 2016 race. but their very public— and lavish — support barely scratches the surface of the real machinations taking place between hollywood’s corporate underbelly and its stake in american politics. the studio lobby most people, if they’ve heard of the motion picture association of america (mpaa) at all, know it as the organization that rates films. it’s the familiar, almost comforting disclaimer that appears before a trailer or film, ranking it g, pg, pg-13, r, or in some cases, nc-17. though the organization has its roots in the 20th century, founded as an effort to self-regulate their content, more than anything, it is corporate hollywood’s lobby. the mpaa represents 20th century fox (owned by rupert murdoch’s news corp.), warner brothers (owned by time warner), disney, universal (owned in part by comcast), sony pictures, and paramount pictures (news corp, time warner, and comcast have all contributed to the clinton foundation). for some, it’s difficult to place corporate hollywood in the same category as more reviled industries like banking, weapons manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals . this is likely, at least in part, because they deliver one of america’s favorite pastimes — entertainment. yet the revolving door is strong, as is the mpaa’s political foundation. in fact, the mpaa’s longest running chairman was jack valenti , who served as an advisor to lyndon b. johnson before taking over the lobbying group. by 2011, former senator and presidential candidate, chris dodd, had taken the reins. dodd, who makes $3 million a year working as the organization’s top lobbyist, takes his job seriously. as the los angeles times reported , dodd has increased lobbying funds and efforts in congress. “ we’ve had a hundred meetings with new members of congress since november ,” he told the publication last year. dodd is a clinton supporter. he officially endorsed her earlier this year. disney chairman bob iger is also a huge clinton supporter and member of the mpaa. alongside saban, iger hosted a hollywood fundraiser for her in august and held a meeting with tim kaine, clinton’s running mate, in september. on that same trip, kaine met with warner brothers executive kevin tsujihara, who donated to hillary clinton’s victory fund this year. he met with fox television executive dana walden, who also donated to clinton. he also met with kevin reilly, an executive at turner, which is owned by time warner, which owns warner brothers and cnn , an outlet condemned for heavily favoring clinton this election cycle. perhaps these private meetings were about gun control and equal rights. or, perhaps, kaine and the executives discussed business interests. either way, the paper trail gets more decisive — and more revealing. what is the mpaa hoping to achieve? mpaa members disney and sony have independently advocated for the trans-pacific partnership deal , the globally loathed trade agreement criticized for granting carte blanche to corporations and stripping nations of their sovereignty. disney has even prodded its employees to contribute lobbying funds in support of the agreement. fox, disney, time warner, comcast, and other media companies have lobbied in favor of tpp . one of tpp’s most dangerous provisions is its intent to regulate copyright and intellectual property in favor of corporations – one of corporate hollywood’s main objectives. dodd is, unsurprisingly, a proponent of internet censorship legislation, which corporate hollywood invariably backs in its attempts to preserve its copyright profits. hollywood studios have been some of the biggest proponents of heavy internet regulation (with regard to copyright) and have waged campaigns against online piracy. the mpaa’s website claims “the most serious threat” to the film industry is online copyright theft. it makes sense, then, that the mpaa would be a member of the u.s. business coalition for tpp . this massive trade group spent $658 billion dollars on lobbying in 2014, according to common cause, a left-leaning nonprofit lobbying organization. the coalition includes members like goldman sachs, citigroup, jp morgan, dow chemical , pfizer , glaxosmithkline , boeing , and viacom (another media behemoth). interestingly, the coalition’s website no longer lists its members, though anti-media easily accessed an archived version of that information. these corporations, or their employees, have also donated funds to hillary clinton in one way or another, often via the clinton foundation, which has been documented to issue favors to entities that contribute funds. dozens of media corporations have donated to the foundation. and — surprise, surprise — the only presidential candidate the mpaa has contributed to in 2016 is … hillary clinton. while it’s certainly the case that hollywood executives lean liberal and many undoubtedly support clinton due to a misguided moral imperative to stop donald trump, it would be naive to presume this is the only dynamic at play. this dynamic is evident in a letter from mpaa chief counsel steven fabrizio to disney’s alan braverman, among others, assuring them of his efforts to pass the bill. “ finally, in regard to trade ,” he wrote , “ the mpaa/mpa with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-ip trade policies such as tpp and the proposed eu/us trade agreement (ttip). ” braverman donated to clinton this year. infiltrating the dnc platform drafting committee most damning is the fact that one mpaa lobbyist, former california congressman howard berman, ended up on the drafting committee for the democratic platform this year (throughout the course of his political career, some of his top donors were hollywood studios). according to an email released by wikileaks, berman met with now-disgraced former dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz in may of this year — two months before he helped draft the platform. she appointed him to the platform drafting committee. that platform was widely criticized for refusing to condemn and reject tpp outright, as bernie sanders and his camp attempted to do. berman helped vote down language against tpp. “but hillary opposes tpp!” some might argue. indeed, after claiming it was set to be the “gold standard” of trade agreements, she changed her mind and said she opposed it. but a leak from the recently released john podesta batch showed there is a very strong chance she will change her mind, again, once elected. and considering donald trump’s anti-trade deal rhetoric against both nafta and tpp (not to mention his incendiary rhetoric), it makes little sense for corporate hollywood to back trump — even if they’re partly responsible for his meteoric rise via the apprentice . in a vein similar to berman’s, a former mpaa (and disney, and dow, and citigroup) lobbyist, jose villareal, now serves as the clinton campaign’s treasurer. though there is no smoking gun proving corporate hollywood is backing clinton with the express intent of ensuring passage of the trans-pacific partnership, it’s telling that the mpaa’s homepage is a tribute to tpp (and, naturally, themselves). it’s telling that the organization donated to only one presidential candidate. it’s telling that executives within these corporations are supporting clinton while the companies they represent heavily back tpp — and in many cases, clinton. it’s telling that their parent corporations, like news corp and time warner , are backing her — and the tpp. considering six corporations control 90% of media in the united states and clinton continually proves her loyalties to big business, it’s hardly surprising she’s the choice of corporate hollywood. and it’s likely they’ll expect favors in return. as dodd said following president obama’s rejection of sopa and pipa following public outcry in 2012: “candidly, those who count on quote ‘hollywood’ for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who’s going to stand up for them when their job is at stake…don’t ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don’t pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.” don't forget to follow the d.c. clothesline on facebook and twitter. please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your

glyphosate’ documents rtwho cancer agency under fire for withholding ‘carcinogenic glyphosate’ documents published time: 27 oct, 2016 01:32 get short url © philippe huguen / afp the international agency for research on cancer (iarc), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on “probably carcinogenic” glyphosate. the iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to reuters. the agency told reuters on tuesday that it tried to protect the study from “external interference,” as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was “the sole owner of such materials.” the scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under us freedom of information laws. the groundbreaking review, published in march 2015 by the iarc – a semi-autonomous agency of the world health organization (who) – labeled the glyphosate herbicide as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” glyphosate is a key ingredient of monsanto’s flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name ‘roundup.' it is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified “roundup ready” crops, also produced by monsanto. read more eu may ban monsanto weedkiller over health concerns the iarc’s report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. the report sparked a heated debate around the use of roundup, and caused several eu countries – including france, sweden, and the netherlands – to object to the renewal of the glyphosate’s eu license. the vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in june 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. the controversial report has seemingly made the iarc a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the iarc's evaluations are fuel for “unnecessary health scares,” since the iarc allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a “typical human” exposure to it. it remained unclear whether the critics urged a who body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. the critics also brought up other controversial statements from the iarc, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. the agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and...freedom from conflicts of interest.” numerous freedom of information requests by the energy & environment legal institute (e&e legal), a us conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. read more bayer vows not to use reputation to impose monsanto’s gm crops on europe e&e legal told reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong

“conflicts of interest.” according to reuters, officials from the us national institutes of health (nih) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why american taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. “iarc’s standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,” a letter from us oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz to nih director francis collins states, as quoted by reuters. the oversight committee demanded a full disclosure of nih funding of the iarc, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency’s activities. read more:

council houses were handed out to unemployed illegal alien muslim migrants. migration watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a “sustainable” level of migration is not achieved. uk daily mail more than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers’ £47,000 salary, it was revealed last month. according to official figures, thousands of muslim migrant families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about £5,000 per month – enough to fund a £1million mortgage. jonathan isaby, of the taxpayers’ alliance, said: ‘many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. uk express (h/t rob e) a spokesperson said: “there is a long standing controversy over the granting of social housing to immigrants. this has not been helped by local authorities’ reluctance to publish the relevant information. “some immigrant groups have very low use of social housing whereas others are more likely to be in social housing than the uk born. there is absolutely nothing in the rules that state that immigrants should get preferential treatment. “however, priority for social housing is largely determined by need and so some ‘high need’ immigrant families (with multiple wives and large litters of kids) will gain access to housing over longer standing local residents deemed to be of lower need. this can be contentious. the 100,000 pre-fab homes(below) proposed by the government are a far cry from those properties “fit for heroes” and service personnel who were awarded social housing on their return from the horrors of the first world war. “in the future, any housing strategy must address both supply and demand. the muslim invasion is a major part of housing demand. “unless net migration is reduced to a manageable and sustainable level a large house building programme will have to continue indefinitely, with all the costs and loss of amenities involved.” a white paper due out next month includes measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct off-site before delivering them to their final destination. a government source said: “the first and most obvious advantage is speeding up the building of housing. “there is pretty good evidence that if you did it at scale it is cheaper.” this has pushed ministers to plan a new wave of pre-made homes to solve the housing crisis. the prefabricated homes can be built off site in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on a site. jonathan isaby, of the taxpayers’ alliance, said: ‘many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits

exclusive: for years, anyone calling for a “one-state solution” to the israeli-palestinian conflict – granting equal rights to all inhabitants and thus “diluting” the “jewish state” – was denounced as anti-semitic. but israel’s persistent settlement building has now left no other rational choice, notes jonathan marshall. by jonathan marshall donald trump’s election victory raises many unanswered questions, but it also settles a few, starting with the fate of the israeli-palestinian “peace process.” in the words of israeli education minister and jewish home party leader naftali bennett, “the era of a palestinian state is over.” lest anyone accuse the israeli hardliner of wishful thinking, one need only recall candidate trump’s insistence last spring that israelis “really have to keep going” with settling the territories that they have occupied since 1967. two months later, the republican party changed its 2012 platform to omit support for a palestinian state and to condemn the “false notion that israel is an occupier.” talks with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu as they walk across the tarmac at ben gurion international airport in tel aviv, israel, march 20, 2013. (official white house photo by pete souza) last week, a co-chair of the trump campaign’s israel advisory committee reaffirmed that the president-elect rejects washington’s traditional view that israel’s settlements are obstacles to peace and illegal under international law. the so-called “two-state solution” — creation of a palestinian national homeland comprising the west bank and gaza, and coexisting with israel — has been a longstanding axiom of official u.s. policy, accepted as well by israel and its unofficial lobbying arm, the american israel public affairs committee. of late, however, the rise of extreme jewish nationalists to power in israel, the relentless expansion of jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and israel’s evident disinterest in peace negotiations have all but killed hopes for such a solution. in 2015, prime minister benjamin netanyahu declared , “there will be no withdrawals” from the occupied west bank and “no concessions” to the palestinians. as americans for peace now points out, “more than 40% of the west bank is under the direct control of settlers or settlements and off-limits to palestinians . . . israel has taken hundreds of kilometers of the west bank to build roads that serve the settlements, . . . dividing palestinian cities and towns from each other, and imposing various barriers to palestinian movement and access. . . such settlements, and new settlement construction going on today, have the explicit goal of preventing the establishment of a palestinian capital in east jerusalem – which, in effect, means preventing the two-state solution.” many of israel’s staunchest allies in the united states now concede this reality. hillary clinton, in a private email to one of her advisers, acknowledged in 2015 that the israeli-palestinian peace process had become a phony “potemkin” spectacle. secretary of state john kerry warned publicly that israeli settlement-building was “imperiling the viability of a two-state solution.” roger cohen, the new york times columnist and an ardent liberal zionist, reported last month following a trip to israel that the two-state idea is all but “clinically dead.” he explained: “the incorporation of all the biblical land of israel has advanced too far, for too long, to be reversed now.” many israeli supporters of a two-state solution now publicly admit that bitter truth. former prime minister ehud barak accuses netanyahu of engaging in a “messianic drive” toward “a single jewish state, from the jordan river to the mediterranean sea.” for the current crop of right-wing leaders in israel, the main question is whether to offer palestinians citizenship within an expanded israel or to remove them. palestinians also concede privately that their dream of a state is dead. said noted palestinian pollster khalil shikaki, “we, israelis and palestinians, live in a one-state reality.” former palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei, declared bluntly, “there will be no alternative but one state. no alternative.” what path forward? if a palestinian state is truly dead, palestinians will need to give up their decades-old nationalist aspirations, a wrenching blow that many will find hard to accept. israelis, in turn, will need to find room in a bi-national democratic state for millions of palestinians — roughly equal in number to jews — an even more wrenching adjustment that many will fight to the bitter end. liberal zionists have warned for years that refusal to accept a palestinian state would force israel to choose between remaining a democratic state or a jewish state. a map showing israeli settlements in the palestinian territories. as former prime minister barak put it , the “overarching ambition” of absorbing the occupied territories “is bound to culminate in either a single, binational state, which, within a generation, may have a jewish minority and likely a bosnia-like civil war, or else an apartheid reality if palestinian residents are deprived of the right to vote. both spell doom for the zionist dream.” an apartheid-like reality already exists for palestinians, but many israelis and their supporters publicly rationalize it as an unfortunate but temporary necessity during a transitional period that will end with a peace settlement. by putting off determination of the final status of the occupied territories, israel can justify subjecting palestinians to harsh military law , seizing their land, demolishing their homes, controlling their movements, and jailing them at will rather than granting them the rights afforded to israeli citizens. israeli political scientist and former deputy mayor of jerusalem meron benvenisti has been saying for years that “the whole notion of a palestinian state . . . is a sham.” israel has maintained the pretense of peace talks only “because it is self-serving,” he said. while talking about two states as a goal, israeli governments continue funding the expansion of settlements. palestinian officials, meanwhile, help enforce order in return for millions of dollars in international aid. but if israeli hardliners succeed in ending the fiction of a peace process and annex the territories , “then the palestinian struggle will inevitably be transformed from one demanding independence into a movement demanding equal rights,” says james zogby, president of the arab american institute. “if this is to be the case, we may well see the day when the palestinian citizens of israel will emerge . . . as the new leadership of a unified palestinian community fighting for justice and equality.” such a fight will face tremendous opposition. in recent years, polls of israeli adults show that nearly half believe arabs should be expelled from israel. nearly eight in 10 believe jews should receive preferential treatment compared to non-jews. the netanyahu government and knesset are filled with overt racists. last year, netanyahu appointed as deputy defense minister a rabbi who asserted , “[palestinians] are like animals, they aren’t human.” the israeli peace activist and public opinion analyst dahlia scheindlin doesn’t minimize the hurdles, but said palestinians may be ready to fight for their rights within israel. “israeli racism [is] better than israeli occupation,” she wrote , “and they probably feel [they] can live with it as long as there are democratic foundations to demand better. maybe for them, israeli rule cannot possibly make their status quo worse, but at least it offers the possibility of something many of them simply lack: citizenship.” democratic rights some hope is offered by the fact that several notable right-leaning israeli politicians favor granting palestinians full democratic rights within a greater israel, rather than subordinating them forever under the thumb of military occupation or jim crow-type segregation. a section of the barrier — erected by israeli officials to prevent the passage of palestinians — with graffiti using president john f. kennedy’s famous quote when facing the berlin wall, “ich bin ein berliner.” (photo credit: marc venezia) as new yorker editor david remnick observed a couple of years ago, israeli president reuven rivlin — a member of the rightist likud party — has “emerged as the most prominent critic of racist rhetoric, jingoism, fundamentalism, and sectarian violence, the highest-ranking advocate among jewish israelis for the civil rights of the palestinians both in israel and in the occupied territories.” rivlin visited an arab town that had been the scene of an israeli massacre in 1956 to apologize and “swear, in my name and that of all our descendants, that we will never act against the principle of equal rights, and we will never try and force someone from our land.” he also condemned racist fans of a jerusalem soccer team who protested its signing of two muslim players. for such sentiments, not surprisingly, rivlin has been called a “traitor,” “rotten filth,” and even “lying little jew” by his israeli haters. but rivlin is not alone. moshe arens, a former likud leader, minister of defense and foreign affairs, and ambassador to the united states, supports giving palestinians in the west bank the right to vote in israeli elections. the key to preserving israeli democracy, he wrote in 2010, will be making them feel at home in the state of israel, “enjoying not only equality of rights but also equality of opportunities.” it will take a minor miracle to persuade the israeli public to risk broadening their democracy to incorporate millions of palestinians, but the longer the unsupportable status quo prevails, the less likely it becomes that any israelis will enjoy the democratic and civil rights they have long known. israel’s media is under assault from the government , leading freedom house to downgrade its assessment of the country’s press from “free” to “partly free.” israeli peace activists and ngos face constant harassment and persecution . rightist demonstrators routinely chant “death to arabs.” former defense minister moshe yaalon, a member of the likud party, recently declared , “the leadership of israel in 2016 is busy with inflaming passions and causing fear between jews and arabs, between right and left and between different ethnic groups in order to survive in power.” and ilan baruch, israel’s former ambassador to south africa, said , “netanyahu is pushing israeli democracy to the brink. . . this is the most right-wing government in the country’s history, which has no qualms about taking tactical and strategic steps in the media, education, and culture in order to ensure netanyahu’s permanent rule. to do that, the government sows racist divisions . . . slanders and preaches hatred for the other — be they arab citizens of israel, palestinians, african refugees, or human rights activists.” still, with the pretense of a two-state solution shattered by trump’s victory and netanyahu’s open intransigence, supporters of israeli democracy and palestinian rights can finally begin an unblinkered discussion of how to achieve a genuine accommodation between those two peoples in a common land. in the words of sandy tolan, author of the international bestseller the lemon tree , “now, at least, there is an opportunity to lay the foundations for some newer kind of solution grounded in human rights, freedom of movement, complete cessation of settlement building, and equal access to land, water, and places of worship. it will have to be based on a new reality, which israel and the united states have had such a hand in creating. think of it as the one-state solution.” watch: police viciously attack, arrest peaceful protesters at dapl including children and the elderly wed, 26 oct 2016 13:29 utc © the free thought project dramatic video from intercept reporter, jihan hafiz , was released this week from the dakota access pipeline protests showing a full on assault by militarized police on peaceful people. the video is from saturday but took several days to be released as cops confiscated the camera used to film it. the video was taken as water protectors and reporters covering the protests marched toward the construction site. however, their peaceful walk was swiftly interrupted by militarized shock troops armed with massive cans of pepper spray, batons, rubber bullets, and assault rifles. according to hafiz, the march was undertaken in solidarity with several protesters who had chained themselves to bulldozers and pipeline machinery at the construction site. but the marchers never made it to their destination. instead, they were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons. dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. \"don't move, everyone is under arrest,\" a voice says from the military vehicle that appears to be equipped with a long range acoustic hailing device, or lrad. as protesters attempted to leave, the police surrounded them and began their attack. according to hafiz, several women were targeted for leading the march and dragged from the crowd to be arrested. police body slammed one man and another woman's ankle was broken as she ran. the militarized police then circled the protesters in an apparent move to 'kettle' them — a tactic usually reserved for urban protests in which riot police force large crowds into corners to seemingly provoke them. however, the protesters stayed entirely peaceful. police continued their mass arrests even though the people were trying to leave. some natives were seen running for the hills as the assault began. one officer is seen in military camouflage with a ski mask and a tear gas grenade launcher — as if he were going to war . in total, reports hafiz, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. it was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. a majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer. among those arrested were journalists, a teen child who was also pregnant, and an elderly woman. they were all brought to the jail where protesters were forced to sit in the jail's common area as police had no other place to put them. according to hafiz, women were strip searched, protesters were refused phone calls, and no one received food or water. one woman even had her medication confiscated by police, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. when hafiz was finally released, she attempted to get back her camera and was told that she could not have it back. \"your camera is being held as evidence in a crime,\" they said. in the land of the free, filming cops assault peaceful men, women, and children is considered a 'crime.' over the past several weeks, the police state has come out in full force as native americans fight to protect their water sources from the threat of the dakota access pipeline. mainstream media has remained largely silent as federal, state and local authorities worked on behalf of energy transfer partners to squash dissent. even prominent journalists, like hafiz, have found themselves targets of the state, charged with dubious \"crimes\" such as \" inciting a riot \" and \" conspiracy to theft of services \" - for doing nothing more than filming protests and the ensuing violent crackdowns. as the video below shows, the first amendment is no obstacle when it comes to advancing the interests of the corporatocracy. comment: we are one breath away from an all out massacre! raffiethey got the heater turned up on high. comment on parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both by facespace facespacehome / badge abuse / parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both matt agorist february 25, 2016 213 comments inglewood, ca — on sunday, police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on manchester boulevard around 3:10 am. when police arrived, they engaged in a 45-minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle, killing them both. in the news release on monday, following the shooting, police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun. scott collins, a spokesman for the inglewood police department said that the couple refused to obey the officers’ commands to exit the vehicle. the officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car — killing the couple. the woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting, and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital, according to the la times. the shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day. mayor james butts, while responding to questions about the shooting, opened up a huge can of worms — both the man and the woman were unconscious. for at least 45 minutes, police attempted “to rouse” them in an effort “to de-escalate the situation,” said butts. after admitting that the couple was asleep, butts quickly defended the officers, noting, “obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened.” however, that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch, nor did the couple have any reason to be violent. both of the victims were parents; kisha michael, 31, a single mother of three sons, and marquintan sandlin, 32, a single father of four daughters. michael’s twin sister trisha stated the obvious when she said that it’s possible that kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out. families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off, according to nbc los angeles. “the police ain’t telling us nothing,” said trisha michael after being met with tight lips from the department. “he was a loving father,” said sandlin’s sister leandra faulkner. “all he cared about was his girls, getting them right.” of course, as is standard procedure for all those killed by police, their arrest records were released to shame them. michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year, and 7 years ago, sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in los angeles. according to his relatives, sandlin had a ‘rough life’ but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver. sadly, these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops, scared of a sleeping couple. share google + concerned citizen perhaps the mother had the gun on her lap for protection while they slept. at least they didn’t drive drunk. these parents did not deserve to die! mary hagerty did she really have a gun, or did the cops just say that to excuse the murders of two sleeping people? lying about weapons is a known police tactic to get out of trouble. sometimes they go as far as to plant a weapon. conscious let’s say they had a gun. how did the police see it if they were asleep. hmmm that makes it irrelevant john and linda robel who gives a fuck about “driving drunk”? it is determined by an arbitrary number that is extorted by the united states congress..we encourage people everyday to annul this police statist horseshit. a felony can be expunged but not a fucking misdomeanor dui. get a grip. this nothing but a government racket and proffiteering of the dui industry.

but, having a gun is no reason for the police to shoot & kill someone. nikkia bailey maybe they were too drunk to drive anon ymous black lives matter also! what part of that is so hard to understand? kburnett isanidiot stop being an ignorant fuckwad racist troll, kevin turdnett. philip williams ryan robbins marie laveaux – i’m not disagreeing with you, i just always like to see some real info before i jump to conclusions. not just a headline. i have no idea what happened and will not put blame on either side unless i see some hard evidence. julie asperger on los angeles local news report they said the vehicle was stopped in the middle of manchester blvd not parked on the side of the road. (both are illegal) seemed strange the way it was presented to us. this makes it even weirder. i passed by and seen there is a large memorial for them. to bad there is no video to see what really happened. cops don’t like being filmed. for obvious reasons. julie asperger yea i was harassed by some a few years back on hollywood blvd and intimidated into deleting video of them using excessive force on cooperating men. i even showed them my press id and tried to be allowed to keep the video they said fuck the press. kimberly reichard emerson the intelligent of us know we’re not. i can’t even comprehend what’s wrong with the people here that still believe we’re in “the land of the free and home of the brave”. it’s frightening to say the least. shawn soto this is so fucked up..wtf is wrong with people. why can’t any one just act right?

alan lammle to help soften the public in their attempt to make them look like they did nothing wrong in shooting 2 people in cold blood… gary harryman shouldn’t the records of every cop at that scene also be released? tray pressley to label them as “criminals” so they can justify the murder. markymark ndahouse to demonize the dead… jamesawyatt as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops, many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform, shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat, cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please, atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate. it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops; the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cop(s) & they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awards/fines; not just on the jurisdiction, i.e. the city, county, state or feds . . . but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd . . . as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals; the awards to be paid by the individuals’ by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdiction’s tax payers. stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long, long way in fostering an awareness by these who have escaped accountability for so, so long of the potentially very expensive folly of this their irresponsible actions which results in so much suffering and many time crippling injury and/or death. mary hagerty i agree, but please don’t use all caps to write. it’s way harder to read. roberto carlos moscoso sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians, for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns. yet, i’ve seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of “irresponsible citizens”. crazy ah? tracy walling otis is that true marco emilio giovanni maltese? that’s truly horrifying if so. if you have a source of those statistics, i would appreciate the link for it. i know it’s bad. i’m not denying that. but i am even more disgusted if it is that bad. :'( i’ve read that cops killed more than 1000 people in the usa in the last 3 years. but i’m sorry i don’t have the link, you can search and you will find it easily. i think usa people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists. alain vosselman i’m stunned.. i can no longer believe this. this is going to be talked about in the future (if we still have one) just as we talk now about stalin’s regime… or sadam hussein’s…. or pol pot. from now on even if we discover new life 100 triljon lightyears away traveling by mega-super-freak-aliesh tech vehicles.. we’ll still be the most amazing embiciles of the universe. aaron beedle the fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is. i would not want to be a black person living in america today. i wouldn’t live there at all. nothing will happen to the officers. they should be sentenced for murder, and receive a full sentence. police officers over there intruding on people’s property and killing pets, killing people just walking down the street or washing their car. i’d i was an american the only reason i’d want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers. ryan robbins you shouldn’t believe everything you are reading online. it’s bad right now, but it’s not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be. all of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be. when the truth finally comes out on most of these stories, it’s on page 6 and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice. aaron beedle it is true everyone has agendas… im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america.. but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes. i would say that at least 80% of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably. females would be close too. when it is appointed rather than earned, such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease, people tend to not handle it well. i heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves. and they are made to. it teaches people restraint. christopher rawson the police across america are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another. that human is a human ,none of us our without fault or live life without ever feeling in over our head….possibly there is another way tim walker i suppose if “everyone” voted for that one independent/libertarian candidate, then maybe we would have a fighting chance. sadly that will never happen. the vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties. with the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose, how can anyone prove that it wasn’t predetermined? i just watched a news video of this story. the mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived. “police spent 45 minutes trying to rouse them and de-escalate the situation”. how is there a situation to de-escalate if they are passed out? 山崎 コロッケ ryan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened. all he said was that another source had different information. if another source has clashing info, of course one of them is going to be wrong. no need to bash him. vanessa white some groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with anarchy. i would never call them for anything. they don’t seem to know who or when to shoot. or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time. pitiful. i will keep the children in prayer. blue thugs all cops are cowards, never seen one that wasn’t a coward and bully. one of the cops got tired of waiting and said “gun” that was all the excuse they needed to open fire. what if that was a white couple with a gun in the car,nearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days. what if they have a permit or concealed carry permit. do you fucking think the cops would have fired 62 rounds into that car and killed the white couple, well do you?. if one of the thug cops did holler gun, no one can ever say anything to contradict them. cops know if only one side is left alive, no one can say otherwise. better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6. that is every cops motto, as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans. linda brown chickenshit bullies this b.s. has to stop. i belive all you say as i have been targeted in canada. first nations people,drunk & drive teens and pot smokers are all targets where i live. every skin color fair game on last two. for sure these peace officers should be heald accountable face an open hearing ( open to public ) ” a fair trial ” and then deal with courts decision. i’m not sure if this happened to my friends it would not end in graveyard. these murders must face charges and hopefully murder one. usn veteran bt, i respect your opinion however do not fully agree with you. i do know a few leo’s. good stock. adult scout leaders. and there was an officer from my childhood past, whom mentored me. however, i can not defend other leo’s actions. i firmly believe that an armed society is a polite society. arizona state constitutional provision — article 2, section 26. “the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, maintain, or employ an armed body of men.” arizona respects the right of all u.s. citizens to carry a concealed handgun with or without a permit, or to carry openly while in this state. an arizona resident permit can be obtained for the purposes of carrying concealed while in other states that offer recognition or reciprocity. castle doctrine enacted right to carry confidentiality provisions enacted right to carry in restaurants legal right to carry laws no permit required right to carry reciprocity and recognition outright recognition right to keep & bear arms state constitutional provisions with provisions as such, arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does california. how does extrapolate these facts? perhaps as arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives, whereas californians do not. perhaps california’s draconian laws encroach upon human mental health? whereby inhibiting residents of the state of california to live in fear rather than confidence? i for one shall leave this contemptuous state, seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring. i shall make arizona my final resting place. (i expect in this forum environment, there may be egregious comments to the “final resting place”). ? i respect all of my fellow american citizens and their constitutional right to express their opinions, as protected by the united states constitutional first amendment. usn veteran margie campbell-threadgill maybe i missed something in the article, but does it state that the cops fired 62 rounds in the car? if so, i missed it. fed1718 xxx department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesn’t make you immune, in fact more whites were killed by police than blacks in the last 20 years. doesn’t excuse this horrible murder of an innocent couple but please don’t fall prey to deluded thinking that being white makes a difference. look for yourself. how is anyone white or black ever supposed to trust a police officer these days? blue thugs fuck you dude. my dad is a good cop and i judge his actions too. you are biased. i’m not and leave ppl alone, they never bother with flat tires so fuck off. chris cochran every single one of these cops needs to be charged with murder, and the police need to pay to make those kids end up having a good life since they will never have their parents to give them one gary harryman yes every cop at that scene is guilty of the same crime. since they acted as a gang, they should stand trial as a gang and all be charged with the same crime – murder. terri spanjer i wish people would stop and think for a minute about how the government is allowing police to murder citizens and that over the last 2 years these incidents are occurring a hundred times a year. it’s all part of the big plan to remove all your rights and terrify you. … ps : yes, 9/11 was an inside job. think. american cops have been given free rein to do whatever they want — the government encourages police brutality. lucas vegen i dont understand, maybe im to young, maybe the uk is completely different. black lives are being slaughtered even in their sleep and we sit and watch idol. i learned at a young age. the country will only change when its forced to, black people need to stand up, we are not shooting practice and we will raid stores, court rooms and banks in the 100’s or 1000’s if money and property is all they care about. more may die, but we all die eventually and will die sooner if we watch idol. this is the world you want to live and raise your kids in? really!? this is not hate talk, but black lives matter marches and speeches should be the calm before the storm… if they continue to kill us and our children in our sleep. i dont think talking should be our last effort. how many more will die it won’t. they’re killing everyone now. desiree m. mondesir insane. i know all cops are not like this but the ones who are…god help them. or rather, god help the people they senselessly murder and their remaining loved ones. how on earth does a sleeping couple threaten you, causing you to “fear for [your] life”?!?! b alan eisen i fell asleep in my truck on a very cold night in front of my house. a police officer wanted to arrest me for sleeping in it, but the night was so cold, he got numb hands and left. ross thompson laurie choate this of course will be swept under the rug as quickly as possible.. they messed up bad on this one.. i would love to see the dash cams vids. but im sure that too is now gone.. very sad that we can no longer trust any person in uniform. how does one “de-escalate” a situation where the occupants of the car are asleep? david lynn courtney freaking terrible and shameful roomtempiq the entire legal system is skewed, in favor of those who have money. no doubt black folks are unfairly targeted/abused/killed by cops, but us poor white folks get cop abuse as well, but us poor whites don’t seem to be killed by cops as often as black folks. that being said, i recently moved to a very rural county and the sherriff’s deputies here are stand-up good guys. they are not cowards or bullies. that is one reason i moved here. b alan eisen i wouldn’t compare rural life with inner city life at all. rural people respect each other. they help each other. the police are neighbors. you can explain inner city hell to yourself. ян кариси in 2015 the police in usa murdered 303 black people and 578 white people. total killed of all was 1140. so far in 2016 the police in usa murdered 33 black people and 81 white people. total killed so far as of february 27 is 166. but, more whites than blacks you say..??? simple, only black lives matter to the main stream media. their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another. also, imagine if us whites acted like blacks when we have one of our own killed by police? when are whites going to loot and riot? thomas headen iii you riot when your sports teams lose, or win, for that matter. percentages sir, say that black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. i think if the percentage were reversed, you would be alarmed as well. god bless. michael mcmaster to put it in perspective, if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then you’d expect that for every 100 people shot, 12-13 of them would be black, and 68 would be white. or to put it another way: left handed people are about 10% of the population. if it turned out that year after year they were 30% of the people killed by police, it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally. anna black whites loot and riot during sports. the real question is where is the all lives matter when this happens? daniel robins one yahoo.com woops, they did it again. todd schacherl so now sleeping while black is a capital offense? “if only they had cooperated while sleeping, they wouldn’t have been shot.” is that what we are to believe? deloren tucker wtf… john and linda robel the blue code of silence is well established and routinely used. tim egan wrote “breaking blue” a book that documents the historical corruption of these “big brave heroes”. orwell was right, ” big brother is watching” and the pigs are running the farm”. line these pos up for the firng squad and make their families watch.. john and linda robel keep voting for democrats all you stupid sons of bitches and kaliforniacators. i’m sure gov moonbeam feels your pain. “must have broke the law”“blue lives matter” -every cop apologist dickhead on the internet what’s wrong with the cops, they couldn’t wake them up it’s a shame nancy keys they had me confused when they said the woman’s twin sister name kisha??? blue thugs everyone in america needs to watch the documentry/movie called ” peace officers”. i bet a thousand to a cop’s doughnut there was no gun even in the car. if so it was planted after killing them probably. stayce wow, i didn’t know things were this bad . it just seems that being black is so wrong anymore. why do these things keep happening? i just ask that all cops and law enforcement be mindful of what they are doing and double check their situation before over reacting. now kids are without parents, this is ridiculous. bless the babies and their parents. lincoln kirby huh i always thought the conscious scared the police more, i.e. us. oh wait they can’t tell who’s conscious and who isn’t. why was i born with less rights than my parents, and my younger family member born with less freedoms than i was born with? the fuck happened. did we stop thinking. δανιήλ ντάνιελ fuck these kind of mother fucking piece of shit police who are just bullys with a badge and a gun hope they all die horrible painfull deaths pieces of shit!!!! broke a whole fucking family for what? pussy bitch ass trigger happy pussy ass pigs smfh! deloren tucker when r we going to start fighting back deloren tucker police are only human like us anthony georgeson this has to stop, this is insane 7 orphans. unarmed people killed by those who are supposed to serve and protect, crazed gunmen killing indiscriminately. this isn’t the wild west, this is a war zone. i know guns can be a tool as much as a wepon. a knife, a stick , a rock, a fist, can be a deadly wepon. how do we fix this start making every stich of clothing out of kevlar. replace fluoride with prozac. can we learn anything from places that don’t have a problem like iceland. it has to stop. the officers involved should have been interviewed by civilians before the went to police academy, maybe they weren’t good with serve and protect. show me the video! dksman wtf this article is full of major inaccuracies. they weren’t parked on the side of the road. they were in the middle of a major street right in front of an intersection. they didn’t pull over and go to sleep. all you have to do is loom at the crime scene photos and see this article is full of false information. they had a gun on them as well. catherine durnford-wang so? for that they deserve to be shot? and they had a gun? so what, again? aren’t guns allowed under the second amendment? zatanique how does a sleeping couple put anybody into a state of fear for their lives? i smell a cover up of monumental proportions by the cops involved. i can’t believe that they could possibly find a plausible reason to justify opening fire on these two people. not only do i want to see a special grand jury called to deal with these cops, police department and city. i want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them, the police department and the city. because of these cops 7 children are without their parents. no amount of money is going to make that better or make up for what they did. on what planet could you possibly justify what happened? smh for real i cannot even grasp this! if they were not conscious why didn’t they try to make sure they were not suffering from co2 poisoning. oh no lets just shoot them and make up any story we like. huh???? david sbraga if you only had the courage to say that to someone face, and not while 6th were hiding behind a kevlar and screen. i’d pray for you, but i don’t believe in prayer, and i don’t believe it would do you any good. mark nasia parents on a date, were asleep in their car? does this headline make sense, i mean, two people shot while sleeping in their car makes more sense, that date would have happened before they decided to sleep, where are the editors these days jevez robinson paul myers surely the same laws should be used and policemen and the hiring officials as is used against gangs and organised crime. lets face it the police force is the biggest organisation of organised criminals in the world!!! blacks, latinos, asians, and progressives must compete and vie for every civil service job. once on, rise in rank and change the system. genevieve friday king two exhausted parents falling asleep in a car in and of itself, not news. hell, i’ve been at work and college and found parents zonked out from exhaustion from parenting…..but to be executed like this???? uh, were the cops afraid the parents would wake up and ground them for a week? or a stern talking to? johndca marible these cops need to stop it. so we’re suppose to believe that this woman and this man with 7 children between them are in a car that late at night just waiting to threaten cops with a gun. we’re really suppose to believe that story? i don’t understand how cops can be so afraid when they have a license to carry a gun, training on top of that, a partner, and access to call for backup. i just don’t get it. if you’re that afraid of a black person on sight, then you don’t need to be a police officer. you need to seek help. last time i checked, it was black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around. yeah, the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of blacks by police. not by a longshot. i’m getting really tired of this and the whole usa needs to revamp its law enforcement system. you can give guns to cops who are suppose to protect and serve but where is the protection for the rest of us? jeff putterman could teaching men to nurture counteract our culture of toxic masculinity? by ann deslandes / thevocal.com.au the feminist and feminist-adjacent internet had a mild implosion in february in response to an article by canadian organiser, writer, and college professor nora samaran (a pseudonym). titled ‘the opposite of rape culture is nurturance culture’ , samaran proposes that the solution to rape culture and other manifestations of gendered abuse lies in the inverse of violence, which she says is nurturance – that is,a deep capacity to create safety and trust that many men are not permitted to develop in patriarchal culture. patriarchal masculinity, as samaran observes, teaches men that healthy attachment needs, such as attunement, comfort and responsiveness, or emotional availability are weak and wrong. as such, men become “less able to experience women as whole beings”, and are “less able to make sense of their own needs”. so, as samaran argues, if men can work together to connect with their capacity to nurture and teach each other the skills and qualities of “healthy attachment”, violence against women and non-binary folks might be turned around to its opposite: nurturance. as a proposed antidote to rape culture (most recently, most painfully highlighted by the now-viral letter written by the victim of barely-convicted rapist brock allen turner), nurturance culture (short title) has been welcomed, argued over, and extended in multiple corners of the social web (and wept over by the mra ones, natch). 300,000 people from almost every country in the world read the piece in the first week it was posted, and it has been translated into spanish and portuguese with more languages likely to come. this is particularly remarkable because nurturance culture is not your typical punchy, between-the-eyes manifesto that is easily parsed through social media channels – it’s long; it draws from fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, racial justice, cultural theory, and science fiction; and it is concerned with no less than the deep, structural transformation of heteropatriarchal gendered culture. when i interviewed samaran via skype last month, she suggested that the length and depth of the piece might actually be the reason it had such an impact. in her words, “the piece seems to have resonated so deeply because it combines current knowledge about the brain and nervous system with an analysis of power”. and, she observes, this kind of thinking is becoming quietly more common. “it seems to me that for those who are paying attention, we are shifting away from cultures of dominance. while on the surface we live in very violent times and so much seems so hopeless, underneath there is a kind of tapping into a vast and deep reservoir of purpose and hope. when you begin to pay attention, you feel and see it emerging on many different fronts seemingly simultaneously. even in very traditional places this change is happening; we see it in climate scientists beginning to legitimise considering feelings as important sources of information , or the field of medicine beginning to grapple with the possibility of a shared consciousness , it’s happening in so many very significant places seemingly independently, such as black lives matter , indigenous resurgence happening across turtle island , the radical mental health movement in work such as the icarus project … so much is arising against different forms of dominance simultaneously and it feels like rigid masculinity is one of those forms and is connected to all the others.” as nurturance culture gained traction, samaran began inviting people to submit their own descriptions of what the “nurturance” she is proposing looks like, which resulted in dozens of stories of husbands, boyfriends, lovers, friends, brothers, and fathers showing the kind of dependable love and intimate care that is indeed the opposite of hurting, hitting, bashing and raping. this included responses from men keen to share their understanding of the skills of nurturance, such as this one: “for at least a little while, especially when someone you are with is in need of nurture, let go of your own needs and desires. what does that mean? it means stop thinking about anything related to yourself: how you feel, what you need, what you think is best. just listen and listen very closely. try to imagine what it must be like to be this other person: absorb everything you know about their history and experiences and try to embody these. listen to what they are saying, and repeat it back to them in order to clarify whether or not you’ve actually absorbed the essential meaning of what they are communicating to you.” responses like this reflects one of samaran’s intentions for the piece – in her words, “for men to teach one another what they are currently learning individually from women about how to be nurturing”. samaran notes there were unforeseen responses too, such as those who “interpreted the piece to mean that men should love and nurture and bond with one another ” . on the one hand, “men connecting more with other men in a way that skips nurturing women entirely is not really my goal…. i’ve even seen all-male panels on masculine nurturance culture!” she laughs. still, she adds, “i think this piece cracked open an existing profound desire among men to be able to get closer to one another. and that is beautiful – men want to love each other, to nurture each other, and they don’t feel allowed. that’s one of the big things i hear is being discussed when this piece is used in workshops and discussion groups and conference panels. i just hope they do it in ways that grow their love and capacity to be nurturing to the women and non-binary folks in their lives – not just to strengthen masculine bonds.” moreover, the answer to the question ‘nurturance is….’ must amount to something more than just ‘not raping or assaulting’, samaran adds. “i’m saying that “nurturance is about learning how to make someone feel safe. i’m saying that it is totally ok to be honest and speak without shame of what we do and don’t know, but social scripts about masculinity put a lot of pressure on men to never admit when they don’t know something. it’s completely ok to say ‘hey i don’t know how to be a safe man, a safe male presence in women’s lives’– because that is about a lot more than just not raping, it is about creating safe connection and spaces in which women and non-binary folks can heal from the massive gendered violence we experience. and, it is about recognising that men need to do this work and teach it to each other because we are already so exhausted from doing it.” according to samaran, another critical aspect of nurturance culture that people have responded to is its discussion of shame: “on the surface, the shame over not being able to provide what someone needs is massive, and apparently that’s a big thing for men. however, underneath, there is a complex operation of shame going on in masculinity. if you have shamed yourself for having perfectly normal needs, you may not realise that you are doing so, and instead may perceive those same needs as shameful when they appear in other people. you may then actively shame people when they express those same normal needs you have internalised as shameful for yourself. so let’s say you learned very early on that needing to be held tenderly and gazed upon lovingly is shameful. you put it away, and can’t access it or even remember it. when someone you are lovers with has that very normal and healthy need, instead of comforting her appropriately, you may treat her as shameful and confusing, or become angry and withdrawn, and then blame her for this tension by calling her ‘needy’ or ‘unreasonable’– when really it is your own denied need that you are seeing. if you can recognise nurturance needs as completely normal and healthy, you can get your own denied needs met, and also respond in a good way to the needs of a lover, partner, or close friend. ironically, guilt and shame can be paralysing and can prevent emotional maturity from emerging. we really do need to understand how to work to reduce shame and guilt and increase our culture’s ability to let people be vulnerable. i’m interested in how we create a culture that is safe enough that vulnerability and being completely accepted as our whole selves is taken as a matter of course, as a strength, as a normal part of daily life, not just in our families but in our society across the board. that is how we will move away from shame and guilt and towards accountability and love.” considering australia’s current crisis of violence against women, i asked samaran about the role of public, government-sponsored campaigns like ‘the line’ aimed at raising awareness amongst young people about consent and the impact of intimate partner violence, and the rollout of relationships education in schools where students learn about respectful relationships. can measures like this complement or help build a nurturance culture? “sure”, she replied. “mainstream media and the education system are both central in raising young people so these programs are helpful. still, programs like the ones you describe are not enough – they’re not a replacement for the daily, intimate work of building a culture that does the opposite of harm. programs like this are resources, but let’s not overlook where the learning really comes from – it is deep cultural change we need, and schools can be slow to change.” in this vein, samaran also encourages readers to consider characters and plots that demonstrate nurturance in popular culture and in existing social movements primarily led by black and indigenous people of colour who are creating the world we want to see: “when thinking about huge social problems like men’s violence, it’s so important to think about what the world we want could look like, and where it already looks more like what we want.” ann deslandes is a freelance writer and researcher. tweet her at @ann_dlandes and read her other writing at xterrafirma.net . 0.0 · doctors mysteriously found dead after summit for breakthrough cure for cancer starkmanthe medical community at large is a gasp as several holistic doctors were found dead after apparently committing “suicide” over the last year. the fatalities have seemingly occurred after a breakthrough cancer treatment was just announced. via alternativenews what is this new treatment? the newly developed cancer treatment involves the human protein gcmaf (globulin component macrophage activating factor). gcmaf works by activating macrophages that are already present within the human body. these macrophages can fight against and destroy cancerous cells. gcmaf is produced naturally inside the body however some people cannot make enough levels of this vital human protein to ward off disease and infection. the idea is that by administering this protein to people, the immune system can be strengthened to fight cancer and reducing the need for more intense, invasive procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. these forms of therapy can often lead to more cancer and deteriorate the human body. what the gcmaf website says: your gcmaf empowers your body to cure itself. in a healthy person your own gcmaf has 11 actions discovered so far, including two on cells, three excellent effects on the brain, and 6 on cancer. amongst these it acts as a ‘director’ of your immune system. time lapse photography over 60 hours shows the cancer monolayer … first changing from corrugated to smooth … as the cancer is destroyed. [t]hen the cancer ‘fingers’ are also eaten and destroyed by the macrophages. this news is welcomed by everyone. well, everyone but the mutli-billion dollar cancer industry. the significance of gcmaf’s power could put a major industry out of business – and that’s the exact reason why the deaths of several holistic doctors has alarmed many. in just one instance, florida doctor dr. jeff bradstreet, m.d., who focused heavily on researching gcmaf, was found dead in a river last year. despite the fact that bradstreet had a gunshot wound to his chest, his sudden death was ruled a suicide right away. this “suicide” – which was later discovered to be a murder – is just out of about seven mysterious deaths that happened in the same time period – all of them holistic doctors who were focused on the potential of gcmaf to treat and cure cancer. in just the last year, sixty deaths have been reported in the holistic community as more natural, less conventional routes to medicine are explored upon. although it’s not known yet whether there is a correlation or not between these deaths, one thing’s for certain in that it seems big pharma has a lot to lose by the research of these doctors who were taken too soon. this amazing video shows gcmaf killing cancer cells: shocking new mock hillary ad campaign warns she’ll take us to war: #enlistforher, #fightforher, #dieforher the daily sheeple a lot of people, especially millennials, are concerned at hillary’s war rhetoric, and especially the stuff she made up about tying wikileaks to russia at the last debate. now an ominous new mock ad campaign about registering for the draft for hillary on twitter complete with hashtags, #imwithher, #enlistforher, #fightforher, and #dieforher is making the rounds, reminding us all how close america currently is to world war iii and which candidate would definitely without a doubt be all about going to war against russia. at first glance, it is scary how real these look. #enlistforher

www.thedailysheeple.com. the failure of us democracy the failure of us democracy how the oligarchs plan to steal the election i am now convinced that the oligarchy that rules america intends to steal the presidential election. in the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. but they do not own trump. most likely you are unaware of what trump is telling people as the media does not report it. a person who speaks like this: - is not endeared to the oligarchs. who are the oligarchs? — wall street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the federal reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled american homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. in order to save the mega-banks’ balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless. — the military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. — the neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of us world hegemony thrusts the american people into military conflict with russia and china. — the us global corporations that sent american jobs to china and india and elsewhere in order to enrich the one percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. — agribusiness (monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their gmos, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. — the extractive industries—energy, mining, fracking, and timber—that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. — the israel lobby that controls us middle east policy and is committing genocide against the palestinians just as the us committed genocide against native americans. israel is using the us to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in israell’s way. what convinces me that the oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes’ reporting and the facts on the ground. according to the presstitutes, hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in trump supporters bothering to vote. hillary has won the election before the vote. hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner. i am yet to see one hillary yard sign, but trump signs are everywhere. reports i receive are that hillary’s public appearances are unattended but trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. this is a report from a woman in florida: «trump has pulled huge numbers all over fl while campaigning here this week. i only see trump signs and sickers in my wide travels. i dined at a mexican restaurant last night. two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see trump when he came to tallahassee. they left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. the place was already over capacity so they were turned away. it turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. the women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages». i know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. i also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country. this is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: the media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only americans but also the world, that donald trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. by controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. all media reports will say that it was a run away victory for hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating trump. and liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as hillary takes us into nuclear war. that the oligarchy intends to steal the election from the american people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in texas. the nrp presstitutes have declared that hillary is such a favorite that even repulbican texas is up for grabs in the election. if this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change trump votes to hillary votes? those voters who noted that they voted trump but were recorded hillary complained. the election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. but who will count them? no «glitches» caused hillary votes to go to trump, only trump votes to go to hillary. the most brilliant movie of our time was the matrix. this movie captured the life of americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real america there is insufficient awareness and no neo, except possibly donald trump, to challenge the system. all of my life i have been trying to get americans of all stripes—academics, scholars, journalists, republicans, democrats, right-wing, left-wing, us representatives, us senators, presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed americans and foreigners—out of the false reality in which they exist. in the united states today a critical presidential eletion is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed. this is total failure. democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the united states of america. will america survive the next 4 years? tim king9 shares 7 0 0 2 citizens of the united states have chosen the wealthy businessman, donald trump, as their new president. trump, who was considered a wild card candidate, will take control of the country in january to fill his four year term. violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise. trump supporters have also been attacked. to say the very least, this is the dawning of a new age in america. to put it mildly, trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign. women, mexicans, muslims, blacks, the media… have all taken their turns at his whipping pole. trump’s harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups. the only people trump hasn’t attacked are white american males. the only people trump hasn’t attacked are white american males. interestingly, trump shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii, adolph hitler. hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups, the communists and the jews. trump rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims. trump’s perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark, as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid, like field harvesting. nonetheless, trump has described them as rapists and criminals, tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means. when it comes to muslims, mr. trump is exceptionally ignorant. he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam. millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of trump, while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously, imitate trump’s bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view, particularly in social media. insults have never been so foul and widespread. everyone is riled, people are unsure of what to do. it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better. more... defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley: “the greatest achievement of mr. trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china” arise president trump (or why it's not the end of the world as we know it) trump's sexual predator characteristics - his grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired on a positive note, trump has backed off on his threat to dismantle obamacare. one thing is certain, donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day. unfortunately, trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis. it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east, in syria and libya. both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel, as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed. the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how obama and clinton operate. it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel, a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than $4 million a day. the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable. the isis expose was a golden moment for trump, even though he didn’t stick to his guns. the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations. while the us government spends trillions on killing, it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens. one great example is saudi arabia, the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international law.these problems have sullied us support for many years. the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation. for clinton, maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task. lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans. parading as a liberal, hillary clinton’s warmongering is legendary. the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate, bernie sanders, was equally reprehensible. in the end, there were no good choices for us voters. the pro-trump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr. trump does not care about them in any way, shape or form. only days after the election, it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed, it is reminiscent of former us president george bush's famous words, \"read my lips: no new taxes\". of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick, each time it was enough to convince republicans. trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals. perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters, perhaps not. in the meanwhile tempers are flaring, and americans are increasingly turning against each other. the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president. he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means. in the post-wwii years there was peace, unless you were black. americans had freedom, unless they were women or minorities. the united states has always waged illegal wars, dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another, was broken. is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years? it would be a very good thing if he did. on one hand, it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump, but giving up is not the answer. if trump goes too far out of sync, or becomes embroiled in charges that he can't pay off or threaten away, there is an impeachment process that americans can follow. re: babylon mystery religion series « reply #1 on: today at 08:44:21 pm » part 2 mother & child worship https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twtzpg2rp-m logged the answer

than democrats turning on each other, and that’s exactly what has happened in the hillary clinton camp. as if we haven’t heard enough of hillary’s incompetence and corruption, a newly leaked email shows a top clinton advisor absolutely losing it over hillary’s illegal activity, and her shocking admissions don’t paint a pretty picture for the democrat party. thieves and liars are commonplace, but when a person is running for president of the united states, perhaps they should conduct themselves in a manner that commands respect. hillary clinton has never been trustworthy in the eyes of rational americans, and even her advisors picked up on the trouble she’s gotten herself in. the leaked emails are telling and have shown the clinton campaign as struggling with damn near every aspect of her run for president because americans are fed up with her lies and corruption. hillary clinton in newly-released emails from wikileaks, neera tanden, co-chair of clinton’s transition team, cusses at john podesta, clinton’s campaign chairman. tanden is upset about hillary using the private email and server system, wondering who could have approved of such a thing, which literally left hillary’s team hoping that the democratic party isn’t “suicidal.” obviously, tanden is angry because the scandal is damning to hillary’s political career, and they are all linked to the corrupt democrat. email from tanden to podesta complaining about hillary’s email debacle tanden actually said that whoever gave the ok should be “drawn and quartered,” calling the whole situation “f***ing insane” in the july 2015 message. podesta even agreed with her assessment and that the refusal to mention it earlier was “unbelievable.” hillary clinton advisor, neera tanden “[i] guess i know the answer,” tanden replied. “[t]hey wanted to get away with it.” hillary clinton has still declined to answer to any of the revelations leaked in the podesta emails. it’s likely that there is absolutely no good way for her to handle any of this. she could claim her advisors are liars, but then we would question her judgment in selecting them. she could admit that everything is true, but that’s just coming out stating emphatically that she’s a corrupt criminal. or, she could just ignore it and hope her lapdog media will make it go away, which seems to be exactly what she’s doing. the leaked podesta emails are not done, and with the election coming upon us quickly, it’s hard to image what else will be released. those of us who actually do care about the abuses of government, unlike the mainstream media, will keep a diligent eye and report what’s found because we all know that the media is trying to sweep this under the rug permanently. too bad for them, it’s not going to work, and thanks to the internet and social media, not only can we inform ourselves, we can spread the information to others without relying on the equally corrupt press who are covering for that crooked clinton. how donald

back on brexit revolution new world order pushes back on brexit revolution november 03, 2016 new world order pushes back on brexit revolution (london) - england's high court ruled on thursday that the british government requires parliamentary approval to trigger the process of exiting the european union, upsetting prime minister theresa may's brexit plans. the government said it would appeal against the decision and a spokeswoman for may said the prime minister would press ahead with the planned timetable of launching talks on the terms of brexit by the end of march. the pound rose on the court's ruling, hitting a three-week high against the dollar. many investors took the view that lawmakers would temper the government's policies and make an economically disruptive \"hard brexit\" less likely. \"the most fundamental rule of the uk's constitution is that parliament is sovereign and can make and unmake any law it chooses,\" said lord chief justice john thomas, england's most senior judge. thomas and two other senior judges did not spell out what action the government needed to take. they also did not say whether it would need to pass a new law to trigger the divorce proceedings, which could face opposition and amendments from both houses of parliament, particularly the house of lords, the unelected upper chamber. once again, those individuals who are pushing for a new world order will do anything to stop the will of the people from being implemented, because those in power think they know better than the very people who elected them. - trunews in theory, parliament could block brexit altogether. but few people expect that outcome, given that the british people voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the eu in a referendum in june. however, the ruling makes the already daunting task of taking britain out of a club it joined 43 years ago even more complex. it also puts at risk may's march deadline triggering article 50 of the eu's lisbon treaty, the formal step needed to start the process of exiting the bloc. \"the government is disappointed by the court's judgment,\" trade minister liam fox told parliament. \"the country voted to leave the european union in a referendum approved by acts of parliament. the government is determined to respect the result of the referendum.\" making clear the government planned to stick to its timetable, the spokeswoman for may said: \"our plan remains to invoke article 50 by the end of march, we believe the legal timetable should allow for that.\" \"hard brexit\" now less likely? the court ruled that the government could not trigger article 50 without approval from parliament. \"the court does not accept the argument put forward by the government,\" thomas said. \"we decide that the government does not have power ... to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the uk to withdraw from the european union.\" the judges granted the government permission to appeal to the supreme court, britain's highest judicial body, which has set aside dec. 5-8 to deal with the matter. investment manager gina miller, the lead claimant in the legal challenge, said the case was about \"process, not politics\" and rejected accusations of trying to usurp the will of the people. \"one of the big arguments (in the referendum) was parliamentary sovereignty,\" she told reporters. \"so you can't on the day you get back sovereignty decide you're going to sidestep or throw it away.\" lawmakers largely voted to remain in the eu in the june referendum. many investors believe greater parliamentary involvement in the process would therefore reduce the influence of ministers in may's government who are strongly pro-brexit. trunews warned listeners and readers back in july about the attempts to hijack the brexit win. read more in the article entitled brexit timetable not set in stone this could reduce the likelihood of a \"hard brexit\", a scenario in which britain prioritizes tight controls on immigration over remaining in the european single market. nigel farage, head of the anti-eu party ukip, said on twitter that he feared the ruling could turn into an attempt to scupper brexit altogether. \"i worry that a betrayal may be near at hand,\" he said. \"i now fear every attempt will be made to block or delay triggering article 50. they have no idea (of the) level of public anger they will provoke.\"

starkmanremember the blind bulgarian mystic who predicted 9/11 and the rise of isis? well, she’s got some bad news for, dare i say it, commander in chief donald trump. via usualroutine baba vanga, who’s known to her followers as the ‘nostradamus of the balkans’, has claimed obama is the last president of the united states of america. vanga allegedly called the election of barack obama as well, predicting the 44th president of the united states would be an african american – also making the chilling claim that he would be the ‘last u.s. president’. usually, i’d be happy to dismiss the reaction to vanga’s prophetic prediction as the public clinging onto a ray of hope in today’s new political climate, but actually, the blind mystic has a pretty great track record with her visions. the prophetess, who died aged 85 in 1996, is alleged to have made hundreds of predictions about the future with an 85 per cent accuracy rate, from her home in petrich, bulgaria. these prediction include climate change and the melting of the polar ice caps, which she allegedly foresaw back in the 1950s, saying: “cold regions will become warm … and volcanoes will awaken”. vanga’s followers also say she predicted the 2004 boxing day tsunami, warning a ‘huge wave’ would descend on a “big coast, covering people and towns and [causing] everything to disappear under the water”. back in 1989 she warned that the ‘american brethren’ will be attacked by ‘two steel birds’, a possible reference to the twin tower attacks in 2001. she also warned that a group of muslim extremists would invade europe by 2016, foreseeing a ‘great muslim war’ that would be kick-started by the arab spring in 2010 and play out in syria, eventually resulting in the establishment of a caliphate by 2043 with rome at the center. according to the mirror she claimed this ‘2016 invasion by muslim extremists’ across europe would mean the continent would ‘cease to exist’ by the end of the year. she specifically said: “[extremists] would use chemical warfare against europeans.” vanga’s political predictions take on a new poignancy posthumously; could her assertions about the elusive 45th president equate to predicting an assassination attempt, or simply that donald trump is, as previously expected, a cyborg? baba vanga for president? anyone? philsilversghostif i were one of those guardsmen and the

the country could go for trump howard portnoyprint in 2012, voters in elliott county, kentucky, came close to breaking a streak that, at the time, had lasted 136 years. elliott county was formed in 1869, and since its first presidential election, in 1872, it had voted for the democratic nominee every time — the longest span of any u.s. county. president obama — like the previous democratic candidates for president — won elliott county in 2012 , extending its streak. but the margin by which he won — 2.5 percentage points — made it, by far, the closest presidential election the county had ever seen, and the first time the democratic share of the vote fell below 50 percent. will 2016 be the end of the streak? demographically, elliott county looks like the kind of place where donald trump could do well. 'russia has no intention of attacking anyone -this is absurd,' says vladimir putin angela boroznaoctober 28, 2016 112 while the western press continues scaring its public of \"russian aggression\" and blaming russia for influencing the 2016 american presidential elections, vladimir putin just made a speech that is unlikely to appear in any mainstream media. share on facebook at the meeting of experts at the valdai club in sochi on october 27, putin said about the u.s. elections: “a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any.” putin called u.s. stories of “russian hacking the u.s. election” as a “mythical and imaginary problem” and “the hysteria the usa has whipped up over supposed russian meddling in the american presidential election,” instead of focusing on the domestic issues: “the united states has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. you would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.” “does anyone seriously imagine that russia can somehow influence the american people’s choice? america is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. do correct me if i am wrong.” putin reminded us who the real rulers are: “the expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.” referring to the western elites’ downplaying the growing gap between rich and poor, putin said: “it seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. and in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favor of the suzerain.” putin reminded everyone that current situation of instability in the world is a direct result of the choice made by the united states after the end of the cold war to take “the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.” by taking this course, the u.s. missed a chance to make globalization “more harmonious and sustainable in nature.” in their euphoria of winning the cold war, the united states “essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. they chose the road of globalization and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. but far from everyone was ready to agree with this.” this victorious attitude led to the system of international relations where “rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely. “ on the western hypocrisy and double talk, putin said: “if the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. but if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.” russian president reminded about the u.s.-led decision “to launch airstrikes in the center of europe, against belgrade, and then came iraq, and then libya,” and turning the un into a tool of u.s. foreign policy: “the operations in afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the united nations security council. in their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favor these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defense systems. they created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.” in the global economy, multilateral institutions also became a tool to promote the interests of few: “we see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the world trade organization and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. and we know this is happening. they see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the wto framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organization itself aside and build a new one instead.” always referring to the u.s. as “some of our partners,” putin stressed that they “demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today.” instead of making osce, “a crucial mechanism for ensuring common european and also trans-atlantic security,” it was shaped into “an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests.” about constant vilification of russia and trumpeting of “russian aggression,” putin said: “they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘russian military threat’. this is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand nato and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders. of course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilization against the new barbarians. the only thing is that russia has no intention of attacking anyone. this is all quite absurd. it is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. it is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. and yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims. the question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? what kind of world will we have tomorrow? do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?’ сша—кнр: на кого возлагать ответственность за развитие ракетно-ядерной программы кндр? | новое восточное обозрение страна: китай заявления кндр о завершении своей программы развития ядерного оружия вызвали всплеск дискуссий на тему «кто виноват». точнее, кто несет главную ответственность за то, что ситуация дошла до нынешнего уровня, и на фоне развивающегося противостояния сша и кнр пекин начали обвинять еще и в этом, причем разброс обвинений разнится от «ничего не делал, хотя мог» до «активно помогал». начнем с высказываний кандидата в президенты сша хиллари клинтон. 13 октября 2016 г. агентство associated press, ссылаясь на сайт wikileaks, сообщило, что еще в июне 2013 года в ходе лекции среди должностных лиц goldman sachs хиллари клинтон указала на то, что народно-освободительная армия китая является главным спонсором кндр. и уже тогда обозначила позицию о том, что если пекину не удастся сдержать кндр от создания межконтинентальной баллистической ракеты, способной нести ядерное оружие, сша могут взять китай в кольцо системы про и военно-морских баз. японская «санкэй симбун» цитирует министра обороны сша эштона картера: «на китае лежит большая ответственность за нынешние действия кндр. он покрывает опасное поведение этой страны» и подводит аудиторию к мысли о том, что налицо заговор пекина, который, постоянно получая от сша за великодержавную политику, решил ответить вашингтону таким образом. в доказательство японцы ссылаются на «чосон ильбо», которая сообщила, что, по словам бывшего сотрудника разведывательного управления министерства обороны сша брюса вектора (bruce vector), озвученным 1 сентября, северокорейская ракета — это точная копия китайской двухступенчатой твердотопливной баллистической ракеты цзюйлан-1, которая размещается на подлодках. выступая с лекцией в сеульском государственном университете, помощник госсекретаря сша тони блинкен также заявил, что о северокорейской экономике невозможно говорить без упоминания о китае. пхеньян полностью зависит от сотрудничества с пекином, поэтому на китае лежит особая ответственность в реализации антисеверокорейских санкций. цель подобных обвинений – вынудить кнр быть «более конструктивной». между тем в заявлениях китайских политиков постоянно проговаривается, что япкп не вызвана действиями пекина, и кнр не располагает волшебным ключом к её разрешению. корни проблемы берут начало в противоречиях между сша и кндр, и конструктивный подход должна проявлять америка. как отметила 12 сентября 2016 г. официальный представитель мид кнр хуан чуньин, суть ядерной проблемы корейского полуострова заключается в противоречии между кндр и сша, и американская сторона должна взять на себя ответственность. «мы еще раз призываем все стороны смотреть на общую ситуацию, действовать осмотрительно и избегать взаимных провокаций, совместно продвигать процесс денуклеаризации, прилагать реальные усилия для достижения мира и стабильности на корейском полуострове», сказала китайский дипломат, отметив, что сегодняшнее развитие ситуации свидетельствует о важности и неотложности скорейшего возвращения к шестисторонним переговорам . 14 сентября в газете жэньминь жибао были отвергнуты американские предложения о том, что кнр должна принимать активное участие в изоляции кндр . там заявляют, что основную долю ответственности за текущую ситуацию несет не кндр, а сша. 21 сентября на своей речи в оон премьер-министр ли кэцян также не упоминал про санкции. 2 ноября 2016 г хуа чуньин вновь заявила, что одними санкциями и давлением добиться коренного решения проблемы корейского полуострова невозможно. комментируя недавнюю встречу глав делегаций сша и республики корея на шестисторонних переговорах, в ходе которой вновь прозвучали призывы ужесточить санкции и усилить давление в отношении кндр в надежде, что новая резолюция совета безопасности оон введет принудительное ограничение экспорта северокорейской угольной продукции, хуа чуньин указала, что рассмотрение и обсуждение северокорейской ядерной проблемы в сб оон идет. однако в важной содержательной части резолюции 2270 сб оон говорится о необходимости возобновить шестисторонние переговоры и стремиться к разрядке напряженности в северо-восточной азии политическими и дипломатическими средствами. это и есть путь коренного решения северокорейской ядерной проблемы . а двумя днями позже, 4 ноября, она же заявила, что размещение американской системы противоракетной обороны на корейском полуострове подорвёт стратегический баланс сил в регионе и пекин оставляет за собой право принять необходимые меры для защиты собственной безопасности. действия сша противоречат усилиям по обеспечению мира и стабильности на корейском полуострове, сказала хуа чуньин, призвав соответствующие стороны учитывать законную обеспокоенность китая. в основе такой политики кнр – как проблема thaad, которую кнр видит направленной на сдерживание его ракетного потенциала, так и более широкое восприятие антисеверокорейских военных приготовлений сша, как направленных на деле против кнр. в результате, несмотря на ряд острых противоречий между странами, в отношениях пекина и пхеньяна работает принцип «враг моего врага – мой друг». проще поддерживать кндр на плаву, чем рисковать более серьезными последствиями, которые могут наступить, если её прижмут слишком сильно. готовность китая расследовать нелегальные торговые связи ряда китайских компаний с кндр показывает, что «окно не закрыто полностью», и это можно рассматривать как попытку ослабить американские усилия по введению санкций против китайских компаний, ведущих дела с кндр легальным образом. одновременно китай и северная корея расширяют экономическое сотрудничество, несмотря на действие международных санкций. как сообщила газета «нодон синмун», 25 октября в пхеньяне состоялась третье заседание межправительственной комиссии кндр и кнр по пограничным вопросам. китайскую сторону возглавлял заместитель министра иностранных дел лю чжэньминь, а северокорейскую – заместитель главы мид пак мён гук. обсуждались вопросы организации нового пограничного перехода, ибо уже в сентябре нынешнего года построен мост между северокорейским городом синыйчжу и китайским хуньчунем. кроме того, в ближайшем будущем будет открыт мост между синыйчжу и китайским даньдуном. кроме того, товарооборот между ск и китаем в третьем квартале нынешнего года по сравнению с тем же периодом прошлого года вырос на 3,4%. в сэз расон китайцы строят новые склады и офисы, что означает приток инвестиций. резко вырос импорт машин из кндр в кнр. вырос и импорт китайского риса. по данным таможенного управления китая, в сентябре 2016 года из китая в кндр поставлено 18,477 тонн зерновых культур. это в 2,7 раза больше, чем в августе, и в 6 раз больше, чем в сентябре прошлого года. в сентябре импортировано 16 тыс. тонн риса, что на 2 тыс. тонн больше, чем в период с января по август. и хотя южнокорейские эксперты объясняют это решением северокорейского руководства о стабилизации цен на рис, поскольку запасы риса, сделанные в прошлом году, фактически исчерпаны, с некоторого времени у них любой факт, имеющий отношение к кндр, расценивается только как знак скорого голода и краха. в общем, пока одна сторона обвиняет и бряцает оружием, другая ищет способы урегулирования проблемы, и это хорошо показывает, кто мог бы подключиться к установлению диалога, но не желает этого. константин асмолов, кандидат исторических наук, ведущий научный сотрудник центра

satellite system, the $2.7-billion lockheed martin vh-71 helicopter, and the $2.5-billion jlens air-defense blimp are a few of the other pricey and failed ventures detailed in the report. out of 23

change the ideology source: submitted by milko pejovic the statement of the prime minister of montenegro milo djukanovic concerning his resignation and the transfer of powers including the formation of a new parliament is actively discussed in montenegro. despite a positive outcome for the opposition forces the situation has not changed. djukanovic explained his resignation by an anti-governmental conspiracy involving foreign intelligence services and the serbian minority. under the pretext of dealing with “conspirators” arrests of opposition leaders and activists are being continued in the country. the story about the arrest of “terrorists” who were planning to capture state institutions of montenegro on the night of 17 october is still discussed in media. special public prosecutor of montenegro milivoje katnich declared the disclosure of this crime’s plan. however, after a few days weapons seized from the militants were not found in the stock where they were delivered. according to workers of the prosecutor’s office the weapons were destroyed according to the order of katnich. the elimination of the main evidence is at least a strange decision. a few days after the elections opposition activists željko šćepanović and gordan konatar were detained on suspicion of financial fraud. according to law enforcement they had a large amount of money with them. šćepanović is s member of the party “movement for change” and is a relative of nebojsa medojevic who is one of the leaders of the df. the persecution affected not only active participants in the political process but also aron shaviv who is the adviser of the df. pro-government media ganged up on him with “accusatory” articles. representatives of law enforcement agencies staged a covert persecution. anonymous letters are being sent via email and sms to regular citizens who support the political initiatives of the “key” and the “democratic front” and other parties. montenegrins are forced to hide their political commitment to the opposition. activists objectionable to djukanovic’s regime are under strict ideological pressure from the authorities and law enforcement agencies. montenegro has long been a police state where it is dangerous to tell the truth, where political changes in the management team does not improve the situation. u.s. intelligence: ‘expect al-qaeda attacks monday in new york, virginia and texas’ shepard ambellasu.s. intelligence: ‘expect al-qaeda attacks monday in new york, virginia and texas’ will terror attacks sweep 3 major cities and help the establishment suspend the elections? by shepard ambellas - november 4, 2016 ( intellihub ) — the u.s. intelligence community has warned that al-qaeda may attack three u.s. cities monday, one day before the u.s. presidential election comes to a head. sources believe that new york, virginia and texas may be threatened but are mentioning no specific locations. “the counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the united states. the fbi, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety,” the fbi told abc news. if such a terror attack were to happen, keep in mind that president barack obama would likely use executive authority to remain in office after declaring a state of emergency and suspending the elections. #falseflag shepard ambellas is an opinion journalist, filmmaker , radio talk show host and the founder and editor-in-chief of intellihub news & politics. established in 2013,

i told you cannabis is great for reversing alzheimer’s? paul fassaby paul fassa you might think i’m joking. but i’m not. yes, the accepted perception of cannabis aka marijuana’s effect on the brain is normally forgetfulness and goofy behavior, so one may not normally think cannabis would be a positive influence for any stage of dementia or alzheimer’s. while in office, president ronald reagan declared: “… the most reliable scientific sources say permanent brain damage is one of the inevitable results of the use of marijuana.” that declaration was based on a lone tulane study authored by dr. robert g. heath that force fed pot smoke into monkeys wearing masks, which gave them virtually no options of breathing normal air, equivalent to 30 joints daily for 90 days, after which the monkeys withered away and died. although autopsies confirmed many brain cells were damaged, critics claimed the monkeys brain cells suffered from oxygen deprivation, not from cannabis thc. many attempts to duplicate heath’s study failed. evidently it was only designed and executed to satisfy the anti-pot agenda. a “lost” marijuana study that didn’t fit the dea agenda but there is a study that avoided the public radar completely, forcing the dea (drug enforcement administration) to withdraw funding on that study in 1974 when the university of virginia medical college researchers began observing cancerous brain cells restored to healthy brain cells in mice instead of thc causing harm to normal brain cells, the dea’s desired outcome. the dea went beyond shutting that research down . all the papers from that research were confiscated and president gerald ford put a stop to any further research on whole plant produced cannabis while encouraging big pharma’s synthetic thc research. studies show cannabis’s ability to reverse alzheimer’s gary wenk, ph.d, a professor of neuroscience, immunology and medical genetics at ohio state university, is one of the pioneers for cannabis research regarding dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. “i’ve been trying to find a drug that will reduce brain inflammation and restore cognitive function in rats for over 25 years; cannabinoids [found in cannabis] are the first and only class of drugs that have ever been effective,” he told time magazine. he believes the stigma of marijuana conditioning from the late 1930s on, still hinders cannabis-based medicine from being widely accepted, but is hopeful that things will change. “i think that the perception about this drug is changing and in the future people will be less fearful.” a 2013 spanish study using mice that are genetically predisposed to brain plaque accumulation associated with alzheimer’s discovered “.. stimulation of cb2 (cannabinoid) receptors ameliorates several altered parameters in alzheimer’s disease such as impaired memory and learning, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress damage and oxidative stress responses … .” (abstract) another research example was provided by independent scientists at the roskamp institute in sarasota, florida with their study, “role of the cannabinoid system in the transit of beta-amyloid across the blood–brain barrier”. that study, published june 25, 2013 in the journal molecular and cellular neuroscience, explained how the accumulation of abnormal structures called beta-amyloid (aβ) plaque blocks neuron communication of brain cells. lead author for the study, corbin bachmeier, ph.d, explained that abnormal production of this plaque wasn’t the source of dementia or alzheimers (ad), but “the result of impaired aβ clearance from the brain.” the research team found cannabinoids from cannabis, of which the psychotropic thc is but one, through both in vitro (lab only) and in vivo (using live animals), enabled the plaque to be expelled through the blood brain barrier. this function occurs normally among those who are not afflicted with ad. (study) earlier in 2013, tim karl, ph.d, a senior investigator at neuroscience research australia , found that mice with alzheimer’s experienced dramatic improvements in memory after treatment with cannabis’s cannabidiol (cbd). researchers tend to focus on cbd, one of over 60 cannabinoids, because it’s without the thc’s psychoactive effects. “it basically brings the performance of the animals back to the level of healthy animals,” karl told sydney morning herald . another in vitro lab culture study focusing on thc during 2012, published in the journal neuropathology and applied neurobiology, demonstrated protection from parkinson’s disease (pd) neuron damage. (abstract source) in 2004, the prague movement disorder center sent out anonymous questionnaires to attendees as part of a study: “survey on cannabis use in parkinson’s disease: subjective improvement of motor symptoms”. of the many respondents who confided they used cannabis for pd treatment, almost half of them reported improved physical motor movement and reduced tremors. (source) go to the comments section of this article to view some positive anecdotal reports using cannabis for alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia cannabis with or without thc’s psychoactive effects according to canadian rick simpson , who pioneered and popularized cannabis oil , “smoking pot lets a lot of cannabis healing go up in smoke.” cannabis oil is a decoction of the hemp plant with thc to produce very thick molasses type oil. rick used it for his skin cancer and post head trauma affliction that mainstream medicine couldn’t handle. then he gave it freely to his small town fellow nova scotia neighbors who cured everything from cancer to cardiac issues. his video documentary, “ run from the cure ” is available free on youtube. currently, most cannabis oil providers use grain alcohol instead of naphtha like rick did to decoct the oil from the plant. hemp plants can be bred to have lower thc levels. that’s what cbd (cannabidoil) is about. it’s used to greatly reduce seizures without side effects in epileptic children without concerns of thc’s psychoactive effects. the psychotropic compound thc is normally relatively inactive in the raw plant. but it takes a lot of plants to sufficiently juice hemp with thc therapeutically. most medical marijuana card carriers are restricted with how many plants they can grow for themselves. cannabis thc has to be highly heated to become more active, and producing cannabis oil involves heating. some patients who use cannabis oil have resorted to inserting the oil or cannabis oil suppositories rectally to experience minimal or no psychotropic effects. of course, there are still restrictions in many states for medical cannabis with thc. but you do also have the option of using inexpensive and legal coconut oil to avoid or even reverse alzheimer’s. it’s also important to maintain a schedule of moderate exercise, even walking briskly for a mile most days out of the week, to help improve your ability to naturally flush out those beta-amyloids before they accumulate. ironically, it appears the fastest growing group of cannabis use is among the very senior citizens who used to be against it. paul fassa is a

announcing as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs, that life is unfair. have they never read thomas gray’s “elegy written in a country churchyard,” more than two and a half centuries ago? what about economic historian david s. landes’ statement: “the world has never been a level playing field”? in the joint autobiography of milton friedman and his wife rose, they say: “everywhere in the world, there are gross inequities of income and wealth. they offend most of us. few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others.” moreover, professor friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice, so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life. what is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new, such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress? more important, what test of evidence — if any — have they ever subjected their notions to? no one has presented the social vision of the left more often than nicholas kristof of the new york times — and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision “just don’t get it,” as he has repeatedly declared. mr. kristof’s essay “growing up poor in america” in the october 30th new york times is a classic example of the mindset of the left. it begins with the story of a poor black teenager in arkansas, being raised by a single mom. sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book. but it does have television sets with huge screens, and apparently, there is money enough to buy marijuana. surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him and that this is a human tragedy. the circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances. moreover, he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement. but that is not enough for mr. kristof or for the political left in general. of such youngsters he says, “as a society, we fail them long before they fail us.” whoa! just when did “society” make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in? and just when did “society” acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it? when the left says “society” they usually mean government. that is apparently what “society” means in this case, for kristof laments that this teenager is “the kind of person whom america’s presidential candidates just don’t talk about.” if the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies, that is their right. but, if they expect the rest of us to share that belief, surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test. but we can, however. the 1960s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to “solve” what they called “social problems.” how did that workout? what were things like before this social vision triumphed? and what were things like afterward? homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the 1940s and the 1950s. but homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the 1960s, wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades. when the 1960s began, most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father. after the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s, most black children were born to a single mother, like the youngster in arkansas today. when the 1960s began, most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father. after the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s, most black children were born to a single mother, like the youngster in arkansas today. very similar trends occurred in england after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the 1960s. perhaps it is the left that just doesn’t get it — or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better. the best of thomas sowell tags: thomas sowell is a senior fellow at the hoover institution at stanford university. his web site is www.tsowell.com . fbi obtains warrant to search huma abedin's emails fbi obtains warrant to search huma abedin's emails zero hedge while we explained earlier today why the doj and fbi had found themselves in the awkward position of knowing that anthony weiner's computer contained thousands of huma abedin emails sent from hillary clinton's private server, yet were unable to access them, we noted it was only a matter of time before this particular hurdle was rectified. a few hours later, according to cbs' jeff pegues, in the matter of the fbi having much needed access to begin poring over weiner's emails, which we now know number roughly 650,000 (and thus will take the fbi months to pore over), the fbi has just obtained the needed warrant. — jeff pegues (@jeffpeguescbs) october 30, 2016 as nbc confirms , the fbi obtained a warrant to search emails related to the hillary clinton private server probe that were discovered on ex-congressman anthony weiner's laptop. the warrant came two days after fbi director james comey revealed the existence of the emails, which law-enforcement sources said were linked to weiner's estranged wife, top clinton aide huma abedin. the fbi already had a warrant to search weiner's laptop, but that only applied to evidence of his allegedly illicit communications with an underage girl. the warrant came moments after democratic senate minority leader harry reid scolded comey, saying in a letter that he \" demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another. \" reid added that his office determined that comey may have violated the hatch act, which bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections. the following screengrab from wapo, perhaps summarizes best how the democrats' take on things has changed dramatically over the past few weeks: meanwhile, the cbs reporter also noted that according to law enforcement sources humaabedin is cooperating and \"seemed surprised that emails were there.\" #developing #law enforcement sources also say #humaabedin is cooperating and \"seemed surprised that emails were there.\" — jeff pegues (@jeffpeguescbs) october 30, 2016 finally, pegues also points out that after having fieled much pressure from democrats for the past 48 hours, fbi director comey has been quietly reaching out to members of congress as pressure mounts on him. #breaking news #fbi director #comey has been quietly reaching out to members of #congress as pressure mounts on him. — jeff pegues (@jeffpeguescbs) october 30, 2016 so will the fbi promptly announce that nothing of material important was found among weiner's emails, or will it now begin a protracted, intensive investigation? will comey resigns? will huma quit from her role in the clinton campaign? will loretta lynch take some of the blame? we hope to have some of these much needed answers in the coming days as the fbi's reopened probe begins gaining traction. share this article... islamic state supporting former national guardsman pleads guilty to terrorism charge in virginia jenna leigh richardsonformer national guardsman turned islamic state sympathizer mohamed jalloh of sterling, virginia pled to guilty in federal court thursday to a terrorism charge related to a july arrested during an fbi sting operation. jalloh, a 27 year old naturalized citizen from sierra leone was arrested on july 3rd as part of an fbi counterterrorism operation in which he had communicated to a federal informant that he was interested in participating in a “fort hood ” style attack. jalloh was apprehended by federal agents after purchasing a stag arms rifle at a virginia arms dealer that had been rendered inoperable as part of the operation. according to the u.s. attorney’s office , authorities discovered during their operation that jalloh was attempting to provide material support to the islamic state by “assisting in the procurement of weapons” to be used in an attack on u.s. soil. following his arrest, jalloh admitted to traveling to africa to join the islamic state, adding that he had quit the national guard after listening to online lectures from deceased al-qaeda leader anwar al-aulaqi. via justice.gov …in march 2016, a now-deceased member of isil brokered an introduction between jalloh, 26, of sterling, virginia, and an individual in the united states who actually was an fbi confidential human source (chs). the isil member was actively plotting an attack in the united states and believed the attack would be carried out with the assistance of jalloh and the chs. …jalloh stated that he recently had taken a six-month trip to africa, where he had met with isil members in nigeria and first began communicating online with the isil member who later brokered his introduction to the chs. during their meeting, jalloh also told the chs that he often thought about conducting an attack and that he knew how to shoot guns. jalloh praised the gunman who killed five u.s. military members in a terrorist attack in chattanooga, tennessee, in july 2015, and stated that he had been thinking about conducting an attack similar to the november 2009 attack at ft. hood, texas. during the may 2016 meeting, jalloh asked the chs about the timeline for an operation and commented that it was better to plan an operation for the month of ramadan. jalloh also asked if the chs could assist him in providing a donation to isil. ultimately, jalloh provided a prepaid cash transfer of $500 to a contact of the chs that jalloh believed was a member of isil, but who was in fact an undercover fbi employee. during federal court thursday jalloh’s attorney , joe flood, stated that the defense plans to “ provide context ” during a february sentencing hearing in an effort to explain the defendant’s actions and what lead to his decisions. jalloh currently faces up to 20 years in federal prison. western qld drovers show solidarity with c.u.b workers by only drinking sauv blanc – the betoota advocate follow on facebook print this post clancy overell | editor | contact the nationwide boycott of all carlton united brewery products reached new heights over the weekend, after it was revealed that a camp of ringers in queensland’s channel country have only been drinking sauvignon blanc for the last five weeks. they join a growing political movement of punters that are abstaining from drinking any of australia’s highest-selling beer brands, in a showing of support for 55 workers who lost their jobs at carlton & united breweries (cub) in june. these men and women are also known as the #cub55. the maintenance workers lost their jobs after cub terminated a machine maintenance contract with employer quant, they were then offered their jobs back again at a 65% lower wage, after penalty rates and other entitlements. e.h pearson cattle company ‘s head stockman, ronnie austin says although he and his mates often punch on with the unionised betoota shearing contractors, joining the cub boycott was a “no fucking brainer”. “i’m usually not a big supporter of the unions, but you can’t carry on the way these blokes have been” “it’s fucking crook, mate” austin says it’s been hard work trying to avoid getting stuck into a few green demons at knock off after pushing cattle all day, but it’s their duty as fellow workers to support the cub 55. “it’s been tough. but we are all starting to get around the lively fruit flavours of the jacob’s creek sauvignon blanc” “the passionfruit and citrus prevail across the palate, which is pretty much enhanced by the fresh natural acidity which provides vibrancy and length on the finish” with the mount isa new years eve rodeo as the next big event pencilled in on their calendars, austin says the betoota boys are prepared to throw down with anyone who questions their choice of drink. “if cub haven’t sorted this mess out by then, well yes of course we will still be drinking white wine on new years eve” “if anyone has problem with it then they can come and talk to me and rocko. it won’t be the first time we’ve had to bust heads in the isa” “in fact anyone who wants to drink vb around me better have a note from their doctor because it’s just bloody unaustralian” it seems the cub boycott has travelled across all cultures and state borders in australia, with workers unions in brisbane marching as well as hipster musicians now being forced to choose between supported the workers and drinking melbourne bitter ironically. newsticker (974) noreply@blogger.com (der

the oligarchy has prepared the groundwork for stealing the election pcr3how the oligarchy has prepared the groundwork for stealing the election in addition to the cyber manipulation of electronic voting (see http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/11/01/very-easy-to-invisibly-steal-us-elections/ ), finian cunningham explains a second method the oligarchy has prepared that would allow the election to be stolen for hillary. the groundwork that has been officially established indicates that a false flag cyber attack is the preferred method. a digital 9/11 if trump wins by finian cunningham there are disturbing signs that a digital 9/11 false flag terror attack is being readied for election day in the us to ensure that donald trump does not win. such an attack – involving widespread internet and power outage – would have nothing to do with russia or any other foreign state. it would be furnished by agencies of the us deep state in a classic “false flag” covert manner. but the resulting chaos and “assault on american democracy” will be conveniently blamed on russia. that presents a double benefit. russia would be further demonized as a foreign aggressor “justifying” even harsher counter measures by america and its european allies against moscow. secondly, a digital attack on america’s presidential election day this week, would allow the washington establishment to pronounce a trump win invalid due to “russian cyber subversion”. invalidation is a prepared option if the ballot results show republican candidate donald trump as the imminent victor. democrat rival hillary clinton is the clear choice for the white house among the washington establishment. she has the backing of wall street finance capital, the corporate media, the military-industrial complex and the deep state agencies of the pentagon and cia. the fix has been in for months to get her elected by the powers-that-be owing to her well-groomed obedience to american imperialist interests. the billionaire property magnate trump is too much of a maverick to be entrusted with the white house, as far as the american ruling elite are concerned. the trouble is that, despite the massive campaign to discredit trump, polls show his support remains stubbornly close to clinton’s. the latter has been tainted with too many scandals involving allegations of sleazy dealings with wall street, so-called pay-for-play favors while she was former secretary of state, and her penchant for inciting overseas wars for regime change using jihadist terrorist foot-soldiers. as one headline from mcclatchy news only days ago put it: “majority of voters think clinton acted illegally, new poll finds”. http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article112635048.html#emlnl=evening_newsletter trump is right. the us presidential election is rigged. the system is heavily stacked against any candidate who does not conform with the interests of the establishment. the massive media-orchestrated campaign against trump is testimony to that. but such is popular disgust with clinton, her sleaze-ball husband bill and the washington establishment that her victory is far from certain. indeed in the last week before voting this tuesday various polls are showing a neck-and-neck race with even some indicators putting the republican narrowly ahead. over the weekend, the washington post, which has been one of the main media outlets panning trump on a daily basis, reported this: “the electoral map is definitely moving in trump’s direction”. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/04/dont-look-now-the-electoral-map-is-definitely-moving-in-donald-trumps-direction/?wpisrc=nl_headlines&wpmm=1 in recent days, american media are reporting a virtual state of emergency by the us government and its security agencies to thwart what they claim are russian efforts to incite “election day cyber mayhem.” in one “exclusive” report by the nbc network on november 3, it was claimed that: “the us government believes hackers from russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week’s presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling.” http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm_tw on november 4, the washington post reported: “intelligence officials warn of russian mischief in election and beyond.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russia-seen-as-unable-to-alter-election-but-may-still-seek-to-undermine-it/2016/11/03/b7387160-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html apparently, the emergency security response is being coordinated by the white house, the department of homeland security, the cia, the national security agency and other elements of the defense department, according to nbc. these claims of russian state hackers interfering in the us political system are not new. last month, the obama administration officially accused moscow of this alleged malfeasance. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election russian president vladimir putin has lambasted american claims that his country is seeking to disrupt the presidential elections as “hysterical nonsense”, aimed at distracting the electorate from far more deep-rooted internal problems. http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/putin-rejects-claims-russian-interference-us-election-43103312 the obama administration and its state security agencies have not provided one iota of evidence to support their allegations against russia. nevertheless the repeated charges have a tendency to stick. the clinton campaign has for months been accusing trump of being a “pro-russian stooge”. clinton’s campaign has also claimed that russian hackers have colluded with the whistleblower organization wikileaks to release thousands of private emails damaging clinton with the intention of swaying the election in favor of trump. wikileaks’ director julian assange and the russian government have both rejected any suggestion that they are somehow collaborating, or that they are working to get trump elected. but on the eve of the election, the us authorities are recklessly pushing hysteria that russia is trying to subvert american democracy. michael mcfaul, the former us ambassador to russia from 2012 to 2014 is quoted as saying: “the russians are in an offensive mode and the us is working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels.” nbc cites a senior obama administration official as saying that the russians “want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process”. ominously, the news outlet adds that “steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet.” nearly two weeks ago, on october 21-22, the us was hit with a widespread internet outage. the actors behind the “distributed denial of service” were not identified, but the disruption was nationwide and it temporarily disabled many popular consumer services. one former official at the us department of homeland security described the event as having “all the signs of what would be considered a drill”. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm_tw could that cyber-attack have been the work of us deep state agencies as a dress rehearsal for an even bigger outage planned for november 8 – election day? the washington establishment wants clinton over trump. she’s the marionette of choice for their strategic interests, including a more hostile foreign policy towards russia in syria, ukraine and elsewhere. but trump might prove to be the voters’ choice. in which case, the shadowy forces that really rule america can trigger a “digital 9/11”. it’s not difficult to imagine the chaos and mayhem from internet blackout, power, transport, banking and communications paralysis – even for just a temporary period of a few hours. months of fingering russia as a destabilizing foreign enemy intent on interfering in us democracy to get “comrade trump” into the white house would then serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. in that event, the us authorities could plausibly move to declare the election of donald j trump null and void. in fact the scenario could be contrived to a far more serious level than merely invalidating the election result. the us authorities could easily feign that a state of emergency is necessary in order to “defend national security”. that contingency catapults beyond “rigged politics”. it is a green light

el formato de la nostalgia hasta el punto de que, según confirmaba el propio canal esta mañana, ya hay más ediciones de “ot: el reencuentro” que de “operación triunfo”. un portavoz de la productora gestmusic reconocía que “se están reencontrando cantantes que sólo se conocen desde hace dos días”. “el concierto de ayer fue mítico, hay que repetirlo. ¿cómo lo tenéis mañana?”, preguntó ayer un ejecutivo del ente público a chenoa y david bisbal, que confesaron estar hartos de reencontrarse tras 16 reencuentros consecutivos. “yo necesito no reencontrarme con la misma gente tantas veces”, apuntó la cantante. bisbal confesó tras las cámaras que, a estas alturas, los reencuentros merecen la pena no tanto por la ilusión “como por lo que se cobra”. “no sé quién es julio rojas porque me perdí el programa de ayer, pero dicen que esta noche se reencuentra con vero, que tampoco sé quién es, y va a ser la bomba porque parece que hubo algo entre ellos casi desde que se conocieron hace

eric zuesse. eric zuesse on november 3rd, morning consult’s jon reid bannered, “poverty on the rise in nearly all house districts” and he reported that, “a brookings institution study , released less than a week before the election, shows that the number of people living in poverty has increased in 96 percent of congressional districts between 2000 and 2010-2014.” that finding fits along with others, such as that the economic ‘recovery’ after barack obama came into the white house in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. according to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the united states, emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman, american wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the great crash of 1929. their study “wealth inequality in the united states since 1913” , published in the may 2016 quarterly journal of economics , reported that ever since the remilitarization of the u.s. from the 2003 invasion of iraq onward (and continuing under obama, with boosts to nato, and invasions such as of libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of american families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. america’s soaring inequality during the george w. bush presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of presidential administrations. in fact: whereas bush’s stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, obama’s coming into oiffice restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the u.s. population flatlined throughout his presidency. the obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of americans. not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under obama. the “share of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holders” soared throughout obama’s presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. so: at least the bottom 90% of u.s. families have experienced none of the obama economic recovery; what ‘recovery’ from the ‘recession’ there is, went only to the very rich. findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new brookings study, that 96% of house districts have experienced increased poverty under obama. the nation’s poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under obama. huma abedin seeks fbi immunity deal sean adl-tabatabaiposted on october 30, 2016 by sean adl-tabatabai in news , us // 0 comments huma abedin is seeking an

the restriction of human action. the war on drugs has been an abject failure , as has been the american ‘democracy.’ it is the same with a corporatized prison system, and so too, will be the attempted overtaking of the american people by a corrupt cabal. if the 2016 elections have taught us nothing else, it is that we should be very careful who we make into our political martyrs. despots and tyrants can rule effectively for a time, but in the end, they always perish – their civilizations and accomplishments with them. the fall of rome ring any bells? it doesn’t matter if you voted for hillary clinton with her ties to the rothschilds and rockefellers, or for trump who has alienated women, minorities, gays, and educated leftists alike with his misogynistic comments, and brash unpredictable actions. this election is a call to find our inner hero . we need her/him, as never before. this election has caused monumental stress because it has exposed our deep, perhaps subconscious desire to shirk responsibility and off-load it onto a public figure. we want an external hero. what happens when someone truly leads , is a different, and positively inspiring story altogether. 1.) what a leader isn’t “when we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self-preservation, we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness.” ~ joseph campbell a true hero, or heroin — the quintessential leader of our time is not a politician. the etymology of the word leader comes from the root word ‘lead’, which means, to guide and inspire. the word hero is derived from both greek and latin words meaning to watch over and to protect. it doesn’t mean to lord over. it has nothing to do with warnings and chastisements, nor the use of force, either legislatively, financially, socially, or politically to get people to do what you want them to do. a true leader doesn’t divide and conquer. they gather masses without trying in a unified cause by being in service, by acting, as anthony robbins once said, ‘as a slave’ to a purpose higher than protecting themselves. this could be family. it could be community. a leader might inspire a few, or several thousand but their work endures, even after they perish because its intent was pure. many leaders are quiet. others are bold, but they are never self-serving. a tell-tale sign of a true leader, is one who needs no ‘credit’ for what they have given to society, and who simply thrives on the action of their own internally driven inspiration. they don’t check the poles and they don’t need your ‘vote.’ as lao tzu has said, “a leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.” hitler wasn’t a true leader, nor was stalin. their rise to fame and power was brief. add to that list, george soros, bill gates, the clinton’s, the trumps, the rothschilds, the rockefellers, et al. instead, look to individuals like edward leedskalnin , the latvian emigrant who built one of the most impressive structures on the planet, not for fame, but to honor a lost love. people still can’t surmise how coral castle was created. look to nikola tesla whose work is used in every conceivable manner still today (some of his inventions known and others still hidden by those who seek false power.) as another true leader, r. buckminster fuller would say , “ you never change things by fighting existing reality . to change something you create a new model which makes the old one obsolete.” the self-appointed ‘leaders’ of our time fight against the masses. they fight against mother nature , and they torment themselves trying to accumulate more power to wield over the world. what could they be reflecting in us is the question we should really be asking. 2.) a true leader often won’t fit in with ‘regular’ society “men do not accept their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and worship those whom they have tortured to death.” ~ fyodor dostoevsky between the years 325 and 787 a.d., many people were treated poorly by society at large because of the different conflicts that were going on. one of the main conflicts in this era surrounded religion. if you were not like the roman catholics, and decided to believe in freedom of religion, you were “excluded” from the roman catholic church and thereby, society. those seeking religious freedom were deemed sinners, and lawless hooligans. this is just one of many incidents in history that we can look back on and observe that the societal conscience always changes. it isn’t absolute. a leader is never swayed by the ‘popular’ or the ‘common.’ they think only about what is best for society in that time and space. there have been numerous outcasts of various degree who were true leaders. malcolm x, bob marley, indira gandhi, hatshepsut, aung san suu kyi, etc. 3.) a true leader can’t solve all of your problems number three is a big one. a true leader will never solve all your problems, and they don’t even try. their sole purpose is to help you find the strength to display heroic acts of your own. they inspire. they exemplify, but they realize that by solving your problems they would actually be taking away your opportunity to learn, and grow. you’ve earned whatever lessons you currently face, but you will also receive the gifts hidden in a challenge, only when you take full responsibility and face your shadowed projections. the wicked will shout for you to change your ways. the divine will whisper, and wait for you to heed the encouragement of grace. 4.) a true leader will never ask you to follow them saints and yogis are notorious for sending aspiring followers away. they’ll ignore them, cajole, them, and even ridicule their seemingly fervent desire to learn from a master. that’s because they want you to do your work first. if you are expecting some miraculous cure or salvation from anyone, even a saint, you’ll be waiting a good long while. this doesn’t mean that divine intervention doesn’t happen, or that we shouldn’t look to others for help or advice, but ultimately, a leader shows the way simply by doing his own work. the one thing we can learn from this example is to do ours, too. a final note — a true leader is ‘god’ in action. as joseph campbell has said, “what is a god? a god is a personification of a motivating power of a value system that functions in human life and in the universe.” no credentials or filibusters needed. about the author christina sarich is a freelance

now in bed with pac staff that donated $500k to fbi agent's wife after investigation justen chartersgetty - justin sullivan the wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of ijr. earlier this week, americans learned that virginia governor terry mcauliffe's super pac, common good va, donated $500k to jill mccabe's senate run. jill just so happens to be the wife of andrew mccabe — the current deputy director of the fbi — who oversaw the investigation into hillary clinton's private email server. if that wasn't enough to give you trust issues, it turns out that hillary clinton herself headlined a fundraiser for common good va. the event took place in june of 2015, just one month before the fbi officially launched its investigation into clinton's email server. according to the daily mail , the fundraiser that clinton helped spearhead raised over a million dollars. clinton returned to common good in october of 2015 for another speech. that speech conveniently took place just one week before jill mccabe received two donations, one on october 25th in the sum of $175,000 and the other on october 27th for $125,000. in addition, one of common good's biggest donors, james bernard , gave the pac $100,000 just three days before mccabe got her october donations. there's more. bernard is a big hillary supporter, too. in fact, he's listed on her site as a “hillblazer,” someone recognized for raising or contributing $100k or more to the campaign. yet, he's the not the only hillblazer who donated to common good before mccabe was given her biggest campaign contribution. independent journal review discovered that louisa cohlan also donated $100k to common good. her $100k donation took place on sept 30th of 2015, which was one day before mccabe received a $150,000 from the pac. cohlan has an interesting tie to the clintons. in 2014 , louisa and her husband johnathan purchased a 4.1 million dollar vacation home that the clinton family used while bill was still president. 'auction planned for home where clinton family stayed during skaneateles vacations' http://t.co/dspxh4qkws #plany pic.twitter.com/8tksmpvl9w other donors who contributed $100k to the pac include: samuel nappi, who is also a major clinton campaign donor and supporter. the late mark weiner , a good friend of bill clinton and major fundraiser for the democrat party. and robert l. johnson, america's first african american billionaire who also donated $100k to the clinton campaign however, the deep ties hillary's campaign has to common good go even deeper than that. the daily mail's investigation revealed the ties clinton's staff have to the pac: zuzenak, who oversaw the donations to jill mccabe, left common good va last may to join the clinton campaign as its virginia field director. he isn't alone in the move. common good va's executive director michael halle also joined the clinton campaign as battleground analytics director in the spring of 2015. the group's former fundraiser, amanda mctyre, is now a finance director for clinton, and staffer marissa astor left to become an assistant clinton campaign manager. and the cake-topper, clinton's current campaign manager, robby mook, also worked for the pac prior to the campaign role he has now. one thing is for certain: such revelations will raise new questions about possible foul play and major conflict-of-interest surrounding hillary's candidacy. because with it all staring you in the face, everything seems all too convenient to just be a mere coincidence. still not over: they are trying to “flip the electoral college” to block trump’s win mac slavo ok, theoretically, everything will go according to plan, and donald trump will be the next president. but technically, the (s)election hasn’t really taken place yet. presidential electors of the mystified electoral college must still actually vote for the president, and there isn’t anything to keep them from ‘voting their conscience’ and choosing someone other than donald trump. moreover, it appears that there is an active effort to flip the electoral college to deny trump the presidency, and toss the white house to either hillary or a gop loyalist. the #nevertrump crowd and plenty of bitter hillary supporters are still hoping for a coup, though even they admit it is a long shot – completely unprecedented and anything but likely. according to the blaze : donald trump may have won the electoral votes necessary to win the white house, but he he’s likely going to lose the popular vote to democratic candidate hillary clinton. and now two electors have launched a last-minute effort to convince their colleagues to abandon the president-elect. “this is a long shot. it’s a hail mary,” bret chiafolo, a washington state elector who previously pledged not to vote for clinton, told politico monday. “however, i do see situations where — when we’ve already had two or three [republican] electors state publicly they didn’t want to vote for trump. how many of them have real issues with donald trump in private?” chiafolo along with colorado elector micheal baca have launched what they call a “moral electors” movement in hopes of convincing 37 of their republican colleagues to deny trump their votes. should they succeed in their radical effort, the presidential decision would be thrown to the republican-controlled house of representatives. […] the electoral college consists of 538 members who are expected to convene in their respective state capitals on dec. 19 to formally vote for the next president… baca said he hopes the move launches a serious national discussion about abolishing the electoral college , which would require either a constitutional amendment or legislation in several states. the speculation is that if this maneuver were to be successful, the gop-led congress could be persuaded not to choose hillary, but to write-in a selection for a party loyalist – like mitt romney or john kasich… maybe even a bush. of course, there have also been reports that team hillary has been hard at work attempting to persuade electors to switch their votes in the hope, however desperate, that they can still flip the election and take the white house: on december 19, the electors of the electoral college will cast their ballots. if they all vote the way their states voted, donald trump will win. however, they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose. even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay! we are calling on the electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton. why? mr. trump is unfit to serve. the larger issue here is that the system is badly broken, the people are harshly divided along demographic and political lines, and the future is gambling on extreme versions of itself – larger than life candidates, and bizarre back-door maneuvers in attempt to hack the system and bend it in one direction or another. trump has taken his place on the stage in a thunderous revolt of the people, but his legacy will be tested out the gates by the heavy pressures of washington lobbyists, intrigue on the part of political insiders and the cults of opposition that are springing up in response to his controversial journey to the white house. the entire political establishment have been knocked off their perch, though their hold on power has not necessarily been loosened. a whole new era is born, and it remains to be seen how it will play out.

exchanging intelligence data with the turkish army to ensure the effectiveness of ankara's euphrates shield operation in syria , retired turkish air force lt. gen. erdogan karakus told sputnik that the move signals major changes in turkish foreign policy. russia has already started sharing its intelligence data with the turkish army, which will ensure the effectiveness of ankara's euphrates shield operation in syria, russia's izvestia newspaper reported on monday. according to the newspaper, the agreement was reached during recent negotiations between russian president vladimir putin and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan. first deputy chairman of the committee on defense and security at the federation council (upper house of parliament) franz klintsevich told the newspaper that turkey quietly joined the intelligence sharing pool created by russia, syria, iraq and iran . \"we pass turkey data on our radio intercepts, electronic intelligence and imagery intelligence that may be of interest to it,\" the senator said. \"in response, they also share information. turkey has very effective intelligence agencies and very good agents in syria ,\" he added. commenting on the move, retired air lieutenant general erdogan karakus, general president of tesud (turkey retired officers association) told sputnik turkiye that the pace of development of russian-turkish relations amid the mounting tension in turkish-american relations signifies major changes to turkish foreign policy. ankara is demonstrating its readiness to upgrade its cooperation with moscow to an unprecedented level , creating prerequisites for further strategic partnerships, including in the military-political sphere. \"turkey pays high importance to the open skies treaty. signed in 1992, it is aimed mainly at strengthening trust between the signatories,\" erdogan karakus told sputnik. \"unfortunately this february turkey denied russia an observation flight over its territory. however the situation has drastically changed since then and russian inspectors now perform observation flights over turkey . this is one of the major indications of a new stage in development of russian-turkish relations,\" he added. \"the exchange of intelligence data, negotiations on the creation of a turkish anti-missile defense system with the deployment of russia's s-300 and s-400 systems, the opening of its territory for observation flights signifies the growing trust in relations between the two countries,\" karakus said. retired air lieutenant general noted that such a development is only more natural as the american 'greater middle east' project equally worries both russia and turkey. to be able to prevent all the threats arising from this project the cooperation between the two countries should be ultimately upgraded to a strategic level. there are no hurdles for the further strategic partnership between the two, karakus finally stated. comment: this should pretty much put to rest any speculation that ankara at risk of coming to the aid of the terrorists in eastern aleppo. russia would not develop such close ties with them if there was a risk turkey would basically go to war against the syrian army, and thus the russians as well. in all likelihood, erdogan is acting within certain clearly defined limits in northern syria. alt-right architect glenn beck opens fire on alt-right: ‘grave threat to the republic’ (audio, tweet) darrell lucusalt-right architect glenn beck opens fire on alt-right: ‘grave threat to the republic’ (audio, tweet) by darrell lucus glenn beck was, by all accounts, the primary architect of the tea party. yet, he has become an unrelenting critic of one of its loudest descendants, the alt-right. he issued his sharpest critique to date on friday’s edition of “the glenn beck program,” saying that this white supremacist and islamophobic movement represents a clear and present danger to this country’s very existence. during the first hour of friday’s show, beck, a charter member of the “nevertrump” movement, declared that the alt-right represented nothing less than a “grave threat to the republic.” the alt-right, as many of you know, has rallied behind donald trump, and effectively took control of the trump campaign when breitbart chairman stephen bannon became campaign ceo. breitbart is widely reckoned as the main mouthpiece of the alt-right, and bannon is the main architect of the effort to give the alt-right a place at the table on the wingnut fringe. has a very clear design for where he wants to take the alt-right after the campaign. apparently it includes building closer ties between the alt-right and the rest of the wingnut fringe. he plans to speak at david horowitz’“restoration weekend” two days after the election. this gathering is a known hotspot for right-wing bile of the worst type. however, beck claimed, the alt-right would have likely blossomed without trump. . @glennbeck : this has nothing to do with @realdonaldtrump or @hillaryclinton … it would be happening with someone like @tedcruz in as well. — theblaze radio (@theblazeradio) october 28, 2016 how’s that, you ask? well, beck argued, the american alt-right seems to be taking its cue from the european far right. listen here. beck said that bannon and the rest of the american alt-right think along the same lines as the far right in europe–“burn the entire thing down, and out of the chaos, we will rise.” he’s apparently referring to an email exchange between bannon and breitbart reporter matt doyle from 2014, in which they discussed plans to “turn on the hate” in order to make it easier to “burn this bitch down.” he claimed that neither trump nor even his most ardent supporters know this. beck was actually building on a facebook post from thursday night, in which he shared an article in the new york observer–ironically, owned by trump’s son-in-law, jared kushner–detailing the links between russia and far-right elements in europe. in a lengthy commentary on facebook, beck claimed that there are disturbing parallels between far-right tactics in europe and the alt-right’s tactics here in this country. just like the european far right, the alt-right in this country is extremely fixated on “cultural preservation and homogenity.” he also argued that the kremlin may already be funding “dangerous people” in the united states. for that reason, beck claimed, the alt-right is “a great danger to the republic,” and must be rooted out by true conservatives. he promised to do chalkboards on these links after the election, but was reluctant to do so now because “right now it would be viewed as pro or anti c or t.” i never thought i’d see the day that i would find myself agreeing with beck. after all, as we’ve seen already, trump has more or less twiddled his thumbs while alt-right trolls acting on his behalf have brutally attacked and threatened anyone who dares speak out against him. moreover, the alt-right has made no secret of its vicious anti-semitism; they were the bottom-feeders behind “ echoes ,” an attempt to flag jewish-sounding names online. but if these people are “a great danger to the republic,” glenn, why wait until after the election to tell us more? i suspect that beck is afraid that he’ll have to admit that he was the architect of most of the bile we saw from the tea party–including its resistance to any form of compromise. that mentality seems to have passed on to the alt-right. perhaps beck himself hasn’t seen it yet–or doesn’t want to see it. still, when the architect of the tea party sounds like a voice of sanity, there can no longer any doubt–the gop civil war is well under way.

recently revealed connection between virginia governor terry mcauliffe, a local virginia politician and the fbi exposes, at the very least, another deceptive conflict of interest that was likely intended to help protect the viability of hillary clinton’s presidential ambitions. these politicians believe they can get away with such actions because they trust that they can count on a complicit mainstream media to cover for their corruption. a case in point is the funding mcauliffe arranged for dr. jill mccabe, the wife of the future deputy director of the fbi, andrew mccabe. mcauliffe steered nearly $500,000 from his political action committee, common good va, and another approximately $200,000 from the virginia democratic party to mrs. mccabe for her state senate campaign in 2015. her campaign had a total budget of $1.8 million, and according to the washington post, in 2015 the state allowed candidates to use campaign funds for personal expenses so long as the campaign was operating. “no, it’s not at all a normal amount [of money],” said state senator dick black, the incumbent who defeated mccabe in 2015 and kept the seat, on the steve batton show . “in fact, the amount that was involved is comparable to what you would have in a full congressional, a hotly contested congressional race.” black, who served as a pilot for the marines during the vietnam war, was later the head of the criminal law division at the pentagon. “the amount of money that was put in was astounding,” black continued. “it was four times as much as the democrats had put into the former race when this was an open seat.” at the time that jill mccabe announced her campaign, her husband andrew was running the washington, d.c. field office of the fbi. he was later promoted to the number three position, and then promoted to deputy director. his wife’s campaign failed, and, according to the washington post, andrew mccabe avoided handling virginia public corruption cases during her campaign and didn’t “participate in” campaign events. yet, given that the main funder of his wife’s campaign, governor mcauliffe, is a long-time clinton ally who chaired hillary clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign and chaired the democratic national committee, andrew mccabe should have recused himself from the hillary clinton investigation—no matter at what level he was serving. according to a cutting wall street journal editorial , “all of this asks voters to believe that mr. mccabe as the no. 3 official at the fbi had nothing to do with the biggest, most sensitive case at that agency. this strains credulity.” it was the journal that broke the story this week about mcauliffe steering money to mccabe. the editorial continues, “before he became no. 3 at the fbi mr. mccabe ran the bureau’s washington, d.c. field office that provided resources to the clinton probe. campaign-finance records show that 98% of the mcauliffe donations to mrs. mccabe came after the fbi launched its clinton probe.” three months after mccabe’s defeat, her husband became the fbi deputy director helping to oversee the clinton email case. not only does this have the appearance of impropriety—it doesn’t pass the smell test. “so the democratic party actually suspected that this woman was a republican because she hadn’t been active in any politics,” said black. “she came out of the blue, which was quite mysterious. why this woman, why was she chosen?” black described how another democratic party operative had already filed to run for the state senate seat, but the party decided that jill mccabe would be the candidate—without holding a primary. as we have reported, the whole fbi investigation into hillary clinton’s use of classified email and private server stinks—and the fix was clearly in . not only did the fbi grant immunity to five people deeply involved in the case, it also made a deal to destroy evidence on two witnesses’ computers once it finished reviewing material found on them. “sources said the arrangement with former clinton chief of staff cheryl mills and ex-campaign staffer heather samuelson also limited the search to no later than jan. 31, 2015,” reported fox news. “this meant investigators could not review documents for the period after the email server became public—in turn preventing the bureau from discovering if there was any evidence of obstruction of justice, sources said.” in addition, the fbi failed to empanel a grand jury to look into the case, instead relying on non-aggressive interviews which were not recorded. we have long maintained that emailgate is not just about hiding information from the public, but is also a national security scandal. the obama administration is clearly using political considerations to determine who receives punishment for mishandling the nation’s secrets. among the latest wikileaks revelations is further proof that president obama was well aware that mrs. clinton was doing government business from a private, unsecured server, though he denied it, and that staff members were scrambling to figure out how to contain the fallout. the washington post reports that another government official who mishandled classified information, leaking it to the press, failed to escape judgment. former joint chiefs of staff vice chairman general james e. cartwright’s “greatest mistake was not talking to reporters or lying about it; he failed to play the washington game skillfully enough to avoid becoming a scapegoat for a system in which senior officials skirt the rules and then fall back on their political power to save them,” writes josh rogin for the post. he describes how cartwright “was a pariah to many of the very important people in washington’s national security elite.” cartwright “pleaded guilty to the felony charge of lying to the fbi during its investigation into the leaking of classified information about covert operations against iran to two journalists” and could face up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine, writes rogin. before that, cartwright was known as “ obama’s favorite general .” but clearly that is no longer the case, or presumably he would have gotten off scot-free, just like hillary, from the highly politicized obama justice department. hillary’s mishandling of classified material was part of her daily routine for years—far more egregious than anything that cartwright did. as rogin pointed out in the post article, cartwright spoke to the new york times’ david sanger about the stuxnet program designed to slow down iran’s quest for nuclear weapons. sanger had previously “had meetings on iran with several other high-profile administration officials, including national security adviser tom donilon, deputy secretary of state bill burns and even clinton herself. there’s no evidence of any other stuxnet leak investigations of high-level officials.” but only cartwright is taking the fall. “in his statement taking responsibility for lying to the fbi,” writes rogin, “cartwright asserted his motivations were patriotic. ‘my only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect american interests and lives; i love my country and continue to this day to do everything i can to defend it.’” we may have to wait for cartwright’s memoir to find out the rest of this story. in 2013, the times’ sanger said that the obama administration was the “most closed, control-freak administration” he’d ever covered. but hillary got a pass, in order to run for the white house to succeed president obama. we have reported on how this administration has systematically and to an unprecedented level targeted leakers and journalists . but the whitewash of an fbi investigation into mrs. clinton’s email practices is looking more and more like a cover-up. that the mccabes felt indebted to clinton associate mcauliffe cannot be definitively proven, but it defies common sense to assume that they both were purely impartial about the investigation into hillary. if only the mainstream media would do their job and report on the facts of this case, instead of simply lambasting donald trump and his supporters for his inartful comments. if only. roger

military deployment since cold war wed, 26 oct 2016 15:47 utc © getty a total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to estonia as part of the biggest military build up on russia's borders since the cold war. britain is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to russia's borders as part of a huge military deployment. a total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to estonia next spring, defence secretary michael fallon said. the move is part of the biggest military build up of nato troops on russia's borders since the cold war . © rex mr fallon said the deployment of the battalion, supported by french and danish troops, will start from may 2017. \"although we are leaving the european union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of nato,\" mr fallon said. london is also sending typhoon fighter aircraft to romania to patrol around the black sea, partly in support of turkey. it comes after an increase in tensions between the west and russia in recent months. earlier this month, 40 million russians reportedly carried out nuclear evacuation tests after officials warned that the west wanted to launch strikes on the country. nato is now pressing allies including the us and britain to contribute to the military presence as the alliance prepares for a long quarrel with moscow. last week, a russian aircraft carrier passed through the english channel as it traveled to syria in a show of force along europe's shores. alliance defense ministers aim to make good on a july promise by nato leaders to send forces to the baltic states and eastern poland from early next year. the united states hopes for binding commitments from europe to fill four battle groups of some 4,000 troops, part of nato's response to russia's 2014 annexation of crimea and concern it could try a similar tactic in europe's ex-soviet states. comment: this propaganda still lives despite russia showing no interest invading any country. france, denmark, italy and other allies are expected to join the four battle groups led by the united states, germany, britain and canada to go to poland, lithuania, estonia and latvia, with forces ranging from armored infantry to drones. nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg said the commitments would be \"a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.\" diplomats said it would also send a message to republican presidential nominee donald trump, who has complained that european allies do not pay their way in the alliance. the battle groups will be backed by nato's 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force, and if need be, further follow-on forces, for any potential conflict, which could move into baltic states and poland on rotation. the strategy is part of an emerging new deterrent that could eventually be combined with missile defenses, air patrols and defenses against cyber attacks. however, the alliance is still struggling for a similar strategy in the black sea region, which turkish president tayyip erdogan has said is becoming a \"russian lake\" because of moscow's military presence there. romania, bulgaria and turkey are expected to soon come forward with a plan to increase naval and air patrols in the area, as well as a multinational nato brigade in romania. for the kremlin, the u.s.-led alliance's plans are already too much given russia's grievances at nato's expansion eastwards. stoltenberg denied going too far. \"this is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict.\" comment: stoltenberg's thinking is flawed since moving troops to a country's border based on no threats is an act of aggression that promotes conflict. next year's deployments have taken on greater symbolism since russia pulled out of several nuclear disarmament agreements in the past two months while moving nuclear-capable missiles into its baltic exclave in kaliningrad. the so-called iskander-m cruise missiles can hit targets across poland and the baltics, although nato officials declined to say if russia had moved nuclear warheads to kaliningrad. \"this deployment, if it becomes permanent, if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (russia's) security posture,\" the united states' envoy to nato, douglas lute, said. tensions have been building since crimea and the west's decision to impose retaliatory sanctions, but the breakdown of a u.s-russia brokered ceasefire in syria on october 3, followed by u.s. accusations that russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election, have signaled a sharp worsening of east-west relations. eu leaders met last week to consider fresh sanctions over russian bombing of civilian areas in aleppo and nato's stoltenberg said he fears the russian warships heading to the mediterranean could launch new attacks on the syrian city. even before the break down of the syrian ceasefire, russian president vladimir putin suspended a treaty with washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signalling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the united states over ukraine and syria. there’s toxic air in your home and this is you can get rid of it naturally pamela bofferdingdid you know that poor air quality in the home can cause a condition called “sick building syndrome”? this is caused by an accumulation of toxic gases known as volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) which are released from common household goods , including everything from your cleaners to appliances and even the food you eat. in addition to being carcinogenic and neurotoxic, long-term exposure to vocs can lead to other serious health implications including, respiratory dysfunction, genetic abnormalities, and dermatitis. it begs the question, what are we subjecting ourselves to, doesn’t it? nasa’s clean air study reports how certain houseplants help to filter and remove toxins from the air. houseplants have long been known to clean the air in small spaces, but some of these plants are more beneficial—and prettier to look at—than others. for those of you who prefer the bright colors of flowering plants, the following list shows the best beauties for filtering the air in your home. 5 indoor plants that will improve air quality succulents everyone loves the ease in caring for succulents and some of these create delicate flowers too. here’s a quick fact: when photosynthesis stops at night, most plants absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide? but, there are a few plants – like orchids, succulents and epiphytic bromeliads that will take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen at night time. meaning, these would be ideal plants to have in bedrooms to keep the oxygen flowing at night. flamingo lilly aka flamingo flowers, these are durable and fairly easy to grow in low light, low water situations. they can thrive for many years under ideal conditions but are hearty enough to maintain growth for up to two years in even the most adverse situations (i.e., this is a perfect flowering plant for those lacking a green thumb!) . they have large, deep green, heart-shaped leaves and produce long lasting, bright red or hot pink flowers. the flamingo lilly is great at removing the toxins formaldehyde (found in many paper products), xylene (found in tobacco smoke and vehicle exhaust), and ammonia (found in cleaning products) from the air. *beware that the flamingo lilly (like a lot of flowering plants) is toxic to dogs and cats, so be sure to keep them away from your family pets. barberton daisy the barberton daisy is available in many colors ranging from white to bright red. the hybrids sold in garden centers typically produce two or more single stemmed stalks with a single flower sprouting from each one. these flowers are up to four inches wide and are quite impressive to look at. the barberton daisy can be grown indoors in medium-levels of sunlight, with moist soil. they can flower at any time of the year and each flower blooms for approximately six weeks. barberton daisies filter out trichloroethylene (found in ink, paint, rubber products, lacquers and varnishes), formaldehyde, and xylene. peace lilly the peace lilly is easy to care for and gives a telltale droop when it is in need of water. they flourish in shade and low light and you can expect your peace lilly to bloom with dozens of striking white flowers in the springtime. peace lillies are extremely effective at filtering multiple toxins from the air. they work on trichloroethylene, formaldehyde, xylene, benzene (used in plastics, detergents, dyes, and glue), and carbon monoxide. if you can only have one flowering plant in your home, the peace lilly might be a good bet. *like the flamingo lilly, this one is toxic to pets as well, so beware. florist chrysanthemum the florist chrysanthemum requires bright light and moist, high-quality soil, so it needs a bit more care and upkeep than the other flowers listed here so far. but with the proper maintenance and right kind of soil, the florist chrysanthemum will produce lots of big, beautiful blooms (typically in the red and pink color family, though occasionally you will see bright purples and yellows) that will last for up to 8 weeks. like the peace lilly, the florist chrysnthemum filters out multiple toxins including trichloroethylene, formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene (used in plastics, detergents, dyes, and glue). *this plant is also mildly poisonous to dogs and cats (if the stems are ingested they will cause stomach upset and disorientation) so again, use caution. if you feel that your home suffers from poor air quality or quite possibly sick building syndrome, start adding some indoor plants to frequented rooms and see if your health improves. pamela bofferding is a native texan who now lives with her husband and sons in new york city. she enjoys hiking, traveling, and playing with her dogs. this information has been

us to hold off on cyberwar with russia until after election - jason ditz us to hold off on cyberwar with russia until after election obama wants to do it together with clinton antiwar.com while the obama administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against russia at a “time of their choosing,” the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. from president obama’s standpoint, the hope is to work with hillary clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against russia, and obama apparently doesn’t want to deny clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she’d inherit. starting a cyberwar ahead of a trump win would be even less wise, as trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with russia, and expressed strong doubts about democratic party “certainty” that russia is behind hacks against them. rep. adam schiff (d – ca), the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking russian retaliation for such a us attack before the vote, with many democrats concerned russia could release “forged” documents to embarrass the clinton campaign. earlier this month, vice president joe biden reported that he has informed russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the obama administration will pick a time which will “have the greatest impact.” russia has denied any involvement in the hacks. statistical propaganda: how many syrians has us regime-change killed? jafe arnoldski (noreply@blogger.com)october 31, 2016 - fort russ - aleksandr khrolenko, r ia analytics - translated by j. arnoldski - hardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the syrian arab republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of syrians. even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information. in july 2013, according to un secretary general ban ki moon, the death toll in syria exceeded 100 thousand. in october 2014, the jordanian prince and un high commissioner for human rights, zeid raad al-hussein, determined the number of people killed in syria to be 200,000. by october 2015, according to un figures, the number of killed in syria was more than 240,000. in september 2016, the un officially presented the figure of 300,000 syrians killed and more than half of the syrian population as refugees. according to the dubai news channel “al-arabiya,” in october 2015, the number of killed had already surpassed 250,000. the new york times produced similar figures. after the beginning of the russian air force’s operation in syria, the figures of casualties presented by western sources did not change for the better. of course, the countries participating in the conflict “correct” the data in favor of their interests and many media outlets operate with unverified information from the supervisory board on human rights of the syrian observatory for human rights created by the opposition. how objective are these disseminated figures? the russian institute of oriental studies at the russian academy of sciences has conducted its own study using data from the central statistical bureau of syria. this was reported at a press conference entitled “syria: the thorny path to reconciliation” at the russia today media agency by the un’s senior advisor and representative on syria, russian academy of science correspondent vitaliy naumkin. in 2011, the population of syria amounted to 22.51 million people. according to the figures of the syrian central statistical bureau, the syrian arab republic’s population has declined to 17.87 million. given the average growth rate of the population excluding refugees, the total number for today was supposed to be 24.64 million people. as of october 20th, 2016, the number of syrian citizens (including emigrants) is 24.54 million. given correct calculations, the number of syrians killed over five years of war has been determined, taking into consideration that around 7 million people have left syria as refugees. according to the institute of oriental studies of the russian academy of sciences, the total number of syrians killed is 105,000. the losses of the government army and militia amount to 45,000. 24,000 militants of terrorist organizations from among the local population have been killed, and 35,000 civilians have been killed. the largest number of civilians have been killed at the hands of jihadists and the so-called “moderate opposition.” around 18,000 in syria have been killed by foreign mercenaries of terrorist groups including citizens from 80 countries. earlier, the ex-head of the israeli secret services nativ, yaakov kedmi, presented almost identical figures of syrian losses (around 40,000 civilians). american assessments, as a rule, range from several hundred thousand to millions killed, which is beyond the boundaries of reality. but the point is not even in the statistics. the death of people in principle should not become an object of political speculation or an instrument of information war. american lies on the number of people killed in syria is doubly disgusting because it is the us that developed and attempted to realize regime-change projects against unfavorable leaders in a number of middle eastern and african “rouge states” by means of terrorists from “moderate oppositions” and fomenting civil wars... the american coalition does not want to publicize the civilian losses resultant of their air strikes on isis in iraq. and yet the coalition has repeatedly hurled accusations against others for losses among the civilian population. during the iraq war (2003-2011), 460,000 iraqis were killed. the assault on mosul is also resulting in many victims among the civilian population. palestinian political analyst azzam abu saud remarked in the norwegian newspaper dagsavisen: “the us has made a mass of mistakes in syria. the war in syria never would have been so bloody if the us had not supplied weapons to rebels. the us, in addition, created the islamic state, which has now spun out of their control.” another norwegian publication, abc nyheter , adds: “the us claims that only 55 civilians and 45,000 militants from isis and other militant islamists have been killed as a result of more than 11,000 coalition airstrikes on isis targets in iraq and syria since 2014…even when the american leadership is presented with the lists of civilians killed in syria and iraq and their photographs, they refuse to acknowledge their deaths.” the russian approach to resolving the syrian and other middle eastern conflicts remains the same: there is no military solution. success is possible only through dialogue and national reconciliation. follow us on facebook! follow us on twitter! donate! ¡demoledor amparo contra salgado, keiko y 72 congresistas más! voltairenet.orgpáginas libres ¡demoledor amparo contra salgado,

domicilio real y ad líttem en avenida san borja sur 520-201, san borja, en la demanda que promuevo, por propia iniciativa y convicción, en defensa de la constitucionalidad y legalidad de los actos del estado, así como la acrisolada moral y ética política que el país reclama, a su despacho digo: que, siendo todo acto del estado, y de personas particulares, pasibles de control constitucional, cuando se violan o amenazan derechos fundamentales, interpongo demanda de amparo contra: a.- la presidenta del congreso, luz salgado rubianes; b.- la ciudadana keiko sofía fujimori higuchi; c.- y todos los congresistas, cuya relación adjunto en hoja oficial aparte, que, en la sesión del pleno del congreso, del 27-10-2016, votaron por la elección inconstitucional, ilegal, antirreglamentaria, con fraude procesal, de 1.- josé chlimper ackerman; 2.- rafael rey rey; y 3.- elmer rafael cuba bustinza, como miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva, según aparece en la resolución legislativa del congreso n° 008-2016-2017-cr, del 27-10-2016, publicada en el peruano al día siguiente, cuya nulidad debe ser declarada, porque se dictó en violación de los artículos 86°, 94° y 102°, inciso 2, de la constitución política; del artículo 11° de la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva del perú; y del artículo 64°, 1ª. parte e inciso c del reglamento del congreso. extraña proponente, con fraude procesal.- a prima facie, la aludida elección fue hecha ante pedido, con claro dolo de fraude procesal, misterioso, nada transparente, sospechoso y asaz temerario, planteado por la ciudadana keiko sofía fujimori higuchi, quien es una persona particular, lideresa máxima del partido político fuerza popular y no ejerce función alguna en el congreso. que ella propuso a chlimper y cuba lo confesó el congresista fujimorista miguel ángel torres morales, al declarar sin ambages al periódico perú 21, el 2 de noviembre del año en curso. ¡keiko pidió ayer y tuvo efecto al día siguiente, por una suerte de arte congresal de birlibirloque, manumitido, porque así opera con eficacia y velocidad el fraude procesal (art. 416, código penal) que ella sigilosamente puso en marcha! no dijo torres morales si tal proposición de keiko fujimori fue oralmente, por escrito, por fax o tuit, ni ante qué autoridad u órgano del congreso lo hizo, aunque se sabe que fue puesta en conocimiento de la junta de portavoces del congreso, que preside luz salgado, recién ese mismo día, 2-11-2016, a las 4 de la tarde, y la meteórica y espasmódica elección fue al día siguiente, 3-11-2016, en horas de la mañana, en menos de 24 horas, sin debate alguno en el pleno, sin que los congresistas votantes tengan entre manos el currículum vitae, o siquiera algunos documentos, que permitieran apreciar o escudriñar sobre si los candidatos propuestos tenían o no los requisitos que la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva exige, como son “reconocida solvencia moral” y una “amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas”, y que “no representen a entidad o interés particular alguno”. obviamente, estos requisitos deben acreditarse con documentos, no deducirse, y no inferirse del aire, por tratarse de hechos macizos, sostenidos en el tiempo, tampoco supeditarse el voto a consignas partidarias, amén de la subida trascendencia del elegido. petitorio que, en estricta aplicación del artículo 40° del código procesal constitucional que permite interponer demanda de amparo, a “cualquier persona”, por violaciones a los “derechos difusos que gocen de reconocimiento constitucional” (como al aire, al agua, al medio ambiente, al patrimonio cultural e histórico, al legítimo ejercicio de la función pública, a la institucionalidad con cabal asidero constitucional, legal y reglamentario, si acaso alguien los ha logrado contaminar o averiar), interpongo esta demanda de amparo por la afectación o lesión, que agravia al estado o a la sociedad en general, de los siguientes derechos constitucionales: 1.- a contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente; 2.- al voto congresal válido, con apego a constitución política, ley orgánica del banco central de reserva y al reglamento del congreso; y 3.- a la transparencia de los actos del estado que garantice el acceso a la información pública. en consecuencia, solicito que, reponiéndose las cosas al estado anterior a la violación de los derechos denunciada, se declare la nulidad (dejar sin efecto) de la resolución legislativa n° 008-2016-2017-cr, de 27-10-2016, publicada en el peruano, el 28-10-2016 y del procedimiento especial parlamentario que le sirve de antecedente, de la misma fecha, donde se ¡omitió adrede el debate! y se adoptó ¡acuerdos, vía votación ilegítima, sin previo debate!, que el reglamento del congreso exige (artículo 64°), pasos procedimentales que son de obligatorio cumplimiento, por estar previstos en normas especiales, atinentes precisamente a la elección de los miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva que le compete al congreso, tal como lo prevé el artículo 86° de nuestra carta política. fundamentos de hecho y jurídicos 1.- derecho a contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente el artículo 86° de la constitución política se ocupa expresamente de la elección, por el congreso, de tres (3) miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva. por lo tanto, los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selección o elección sea minuciosa, ponderada, responsable y legítima, contando con los elementos de juicio del caso. no se elige a ciegas, por consignas inalámbricas, sin verle la cara al elegido, sin escucharlo y sin examinar quién es, como en realidad se hizo. ¡se violó, pues, con suma torpeza esta norma constitucional! como quiera que la propia constitución política no consigna otros ingredientes de tal elección, ella misma se remite a que sea el reglamento del congreso el que la desarrolle. de eso se ocupa el artículo 94° de la misma carta política, cuando establece: “el congreso elabora y aprueba su reglamento, que tiene fuerza de ley”. con este reglamento el congreso opera, actúa o funciona y no a discreción de la presidenta, o pero aún de una persona particular como keiko fujimori. con tal sentido y propósito el aludido y vigente reglamento del congreso trata expresamente de la elección de esos tres directores, en un llamado “procedimiento parlamentario especial”, el mismo que ha sido burlado, transgredido o violado, pese a su asidero constitucional y su indiscutido rango legal. veamos lo que establece su artículo 64°, inciso c, del “procedimiento especial”, como uno de los 3 “procedimientos parlamentarios”: “los procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del congreso destinados a producir leyes y resoluciones legislativas, actos de control político y designaciones y nombramientos. pueden ser: a.- procedimiento legislativo; que comprende el debate y aprobación de leyes ordinarias, leyes orgánicas, leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislación delegada, leyes presupuestales y financieras, leyes de demarcación territorial, leyes de reforma de la constitución política, del reglamento del congreso y de resoluciones legislativas. b.- procedimientos del control político; que comprende la investidura del consejo de ministros, la interpelación a los ministros, la invitación a los ministros para que informen, las preguntas a los ministros, la solicitud de información a los ministros y a la administración en general, la censura y la extensión de confianza a los ministros, la investigación sobre cualquier asunto de interés público, la dación de cuenta y el antejuicio político. c.- procedimientos especiales; que comprende la designación del contralor, la elección del defensor del pueblo, de los miembros del tribunal constitucional y de 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva, así como la ratificación del presidente de dicho banco y del superintendente de banca y seguros”. (artículo modificado aprobado por el pleno del congreso de fecha 6 de marzo de 1998). en consecuencia, el “procedimiento especial”, donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuestión, vulneró o violó lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria de este artículo 64° del reglamento del congreso, aplicable a aquél, respecto de todo “procedimiento parlamentario”, que es definido como el “conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del congreso destinados a producir...resoluciones legislativas, actos de control político y designaciones y nombramientos”. lo real y apodíctico fue que en aquella sesión donde se produjo la elección ¡no hubo debate alguno!, por lo que no se examinó nada que permita colegir que se eligieron o escogieron a quienes tenían una “reconocida solvencia moral” o quizá “amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas”. ¡todo fue un remedo! como se podrá fácilmente advertir la elección del jueves 27-10-2016 ¡no se hizo en un procedimiento especial reglamentario!, sino en uno trucado, ¡sin promover el debate!, y, además, ¡sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto de dicho debate! por lo tanto, no solo se transgredió el artículo 86° de la constitución política, sino también la primera parte y además el inciso c del artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso, de expreso fundamento constitucional, con lo cual la ciudadanía peruana toda, de la que formo parte, resultó agraviada en su derecho a contar con funcionarios del banco central de reserva constitucional, legal y reglamentariamente elegidos. ¡por ende, los 3 ciudadanos que de este modo vedado resultaron electos: josé chlimper ackerman, rafael rey rey y elmer rafael cuba bustinza, frente a una proposición de keiko fujimori con fraude procesal, son ilegítimos! 2.- derecho al voto congresal válido, con apego a constitución política, ley orgánica del banco central de reserva y reglamento del congreso como se sabe la elección de los 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva fue por 84 votos, la de elmer cuba; por 72, la de josé chlimper; y por 71, la de rafael rey. ningún guarismo de esa votación puede considerarse válido, legítimo, porque ninguno de los votantes tenía la información documental que oficialmente se debería haber presentado, distribuido a cada uno de los parlamentarios y examinada como fundamento de su voto. la propia misteriosa proposición de dos candidaturas por keiko fujimori sabemos que no apareja ningún documento de los candidatos, pese a que la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva, en su artículo 11°, exige como requisitos, de los que aspiren a ser miembros del directorio del banco, tener “reconocida solvencia moral” y una “amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas”. se trata de elementos reales, de hechos que deben probarse con documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante sí, para analizar, contrastar, evaluar y decidir su voto con apego a derecho, sin falsear su decisión a través del voto no informado o por intereses vitandos que agreden al país. reza el violado y desacatado, al votar inválidamente, artículo 11° de la citada ley orgánica: “ los directores deben ser peruanos, tener reconocida solvencia moral y poseer amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas. no representan a entidad o interés particular alguno y su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad y las funciones del banco”. si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron, dentro del llevado a cabo “procedimiento especial parlamentario”, al que hemos antes glosado, ningún documento de los 3 propuestos, 2 por keiko y otro dizque por el apra, ni hubo debate alguno –el cual se obvió adrede- respecto de sus calidades personales y profesionales, el voto que emitieron fue ciego, inducido por el mentado fraude, sin deliberación mental alguna, al carecer de elementos de juicio objetivos reales sobre esa “reconocida solvencia moral”, la necesaria “amplia competencia” y además la “amplia experiencia” que deben favorecer a cada uno de los propuestos para un voto aprobatorio, válidamente emitido. ¡si los hechos-requisitos y su prueba concomitante no están ante sí del congresista votante, su voto resulta viciado, por ende ilegítimo y nulo! 3.- derecho a la transparencia de los actos del estado que garantice el acceso a la información pública. todo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario de elección de estos 3 directores del bcrp fue transparente; todo fue turbio, de principio a fin, con un clarísimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada keiko fujimori. tanto la repentina proposición fraudulenta hecha por keiko fujimori, el día 26-10-2016, un día antes de la elección, sin que se sepa hasta hoy cómo fue, ante una junta de portavoces que no recibió ni vio los currículum vitae de los propuestos; así como la aluvional votación llevada a cabo el día siguiente, el jueves 27-10-2016, sin examinar ningún documento acerca de los requisitos que la ley exige a los candidatos y sin el debate que el artículo 64° del reglamento del congreso requiere para esta elección específica, en un procedimiento parlamentario especial, en relación a las calidades personales y profesionales, de los 3 futuros miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva, no reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar a los actos del estado, como éste del congreso, que prevé y regula la ley 27806, o ley de transparencia, a fin de garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso a la información que consagra el numeral 5 del artículo 2 de la constitución política. cuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuestión no son transparentes, como en efecto no lo han sido, el derecho fundamental a la información pública resulta vulnerado, lo cual debe ser reparado. ¿fue la bravura de una bravísima keiko, su audacia o un interés nefando que la llevó a proponer con fraude a miembros del bcrp? ¡por lo menos, se sabe que fue keiko fujimori quien propuso, ¿oralmente o por escrito?, a su secretario general de su partido político, josé chlimper y a su ocasional asesor elmer cuba, como directores del bcrp, ambos activistas de su campaña electoral presidencial última, y ninguno de los 72 congresistas suyos chistó, rechistó, ni hizo amago de mueca alguna, todos doblegaron la cerviz y designaron, de un día a otro, mediante su voto, a los propuestos, sin trámite ni debate alguno, ciegamente, sin examen de requisitos legales y sin tener a la vista a semejantes candidatos, ni siquiera oírlos porque tenían una premura inusitada! ¿tiene una persona particular, como keiko fujimori, lideresa de una agrupación partidaria, el derecho de proponer, con efectos legales e inmediatos, en un procedimiento especial parlamentario, sin ser congresista, a directores del citado banco, nada menos que al secretario general de su partido fuerza popular y a otro activista de su reciente campaña electoral presidencial? ¿serán los propuestos, de contundente actuación político partidaria, las personas independientes que contribuyan a la autonomía que requiere el bcrp sin poner en riesgo la confidencialidad de una sana política bancaria y monetaria en particular? ¡lo confiesa alegremente que ella fue la que propuso a estos 2 candidatos, su atento y comedido lugarteniente congresista miguel torres morales, hijo de un antiguo fujimorista, ultramontano, carlos torres y torres lara, ya fallecido; pero que dejó a su heredero universal en el congreso y precisamente al lado o detrás de keiko. ¡su padre estuvo detrás de don alberto, hoy preso! si esta proposición fraudulenta, silenciosa y nada transparente fue suficiente para que 72 votaran por ella, significa que keiko fujimori ¡maneja a su antojo a los 72 congresistas de su partido fuerza popular, ora directamente o por interpósita persona, como lo hacía antes vladimiro montesinos torres (hoy también preso), en los años 90! además, la proposición y decisión adoptada viola el texto expreso del artículo 11° de la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva del perú. inconstitucional, ilegalidad, delito y producto ilegítimo la conducta es la pluralidad de actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad; y el producto es el resultado conseguido con esa conducta. los congresistas, mayormente fujimoristas, que designaron a josé chlimper, rafael rey y elmer cuba, para integrar el directorio del banco central de reserva del perú (bcrp), violaron la constitución política, las leyes orgánica de dicho banco, de transparencia y el reglamento del congreso de la república, en la forma antes anotada. cuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos, como es designar miembros del directorio del bcrp, o integrantes de otros organismos, están obligados a respetar las normas constitucionales y las legales de todo tipo y no zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad. su designio es respetar las normas preexistentes. la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva del perú, en su artículo 11°, obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del banco a quienes tienen \"reconocida solvencia moral\" y además \"amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas\", requisitos que son hechos macizos, que deben ser reales y acreditados con los documentos respectivos. el congresista que vota por alguien propuesto no puede crear estos hechos en su cabeza, deducirlos de meros dichos o inferirlos por consigna partidaria. viola la ley si desoye este mandato legal; comete, pues, una ilegalidad, una arbitrariedad. del mismo modo, todo parlamentario debe \"velar por el respeto de la constitución y de las leyes\", porque así lo establece el artículo 102°, inciso 2, de la constitución política. hasta podríamos aseverar que deben dar el ejemplo en acatar la constitución y lo que dispone toda norma legal. este precepto constitucional fue desacatado por todos aquellos congresistas que designaron con su voto a chlimper, rey y cuba, como miembros del bcrp, sin que estén acreditadas las situaciones de hecho que la citada ley orgánica ha previsto. violaron, por ende, esa norma constitucional que les obliga a respetar las leyes en general y la del bcrp en particular. ¡produjeron una infracción constitucional! esta acción judicial (proceso de amparo) debe anular el ilegal acto administrativo que surgió sobre la base de dicha ilegalidad e inconstitucionalidad y el quehacer delictivo fraudulento antes reseñado y hacer efectiva la responsabilidad de los infractores si no está cubierta por la inviolabilidad de votos y opiniones. el delito de fraude procesal que se ha cometido está previsto en el artículo 416° del código penal, que sanciona el uso de cualquier medio fraudulento para obtener resolución contraria a la ley. en efecto, se violó el artículo 11° de la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva, sin que se conozcan si los propuestos por keiko reunían los requisitos exigidos. medios probatorios ofrezco como medio de prueba puntual, lo siguiente: a.- copia de la resolución legislativa n° 008-2016-2017-cr; b.- copia de la nota periodística de perú 21, del 2 de noviembre del 2016. c.- 3 copias de la relación de congresistas demandados que votaron aquel 27-10-2016. anexos a.- copia del dni del demandante, anexo 1; b.- copia de la resolución legislativa, anexo 2; c.- copia del periódico perú 21 del 2-11-2016, anexo 3; d.- 3 copias de la relación de los congresistas demandados y que votaron aquel 27-10-2016. por tanto: solicito, a vuestro juzgado constitucional, admitir la presente demanda de amparo contra luz salgado rubianes, presidenta del congreso, keiko sofía fujimori higuchi y otros más, tramitarla conforme a ley y declararla fundada, en su oportunidad. otrosí digo.- pido al juzgado que se sirva requerir oficialmente la relación de los congresistas que votaron por la elección de los señores josé chlimper ackerman, rafael rey rey y elmer rafael cuba bustinza, a quienes también los estoy demandando y el juzgado los considerará como tales, al haber cumplido sumisamente con el sentido de la proposición fraudulenta que les formuló su codemandada keiko sofía fujimori higuchi. lo hago de este modo ya que en la web del congreso no aparece esta relación de los congresistas que votaron del modo cuestionado. ni siquiera es posible agenciarse del acta de la indicada sesión del pleno de aquel aciago 27-10-2016. aunque unos colaboradores me han proporcionado el documento respectivo que acompaño. lima, 04 de noviembre del 2016. tomado de http://senaldealerta.pe/noticias/%c... the sad saga of john walker lindh, rebel without a clue beau albrecht the sad saga of john walker lindh, rebel without a clue the sad saga of john walker lindh, rebel without a clue beau albrecht my father was a high-ranking student radical poobah and still thinks castro is the bees' knees. although this makes me technically a red diaper baby, i rejected all that baloney early on. these days, i write stories - mostly comedy science fiction - as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice, political commentary, and my writing projects. november 15, 2016 culture john walker lindh grew up in the washington, d.c. area. his family brought him to california when he was ten. in another ten years, he would become known as the american taliban. while in afghanistan, he was known as sulayman al-faris, one of several arabic monikers he’s used over the years. johnny joins the jihad there are moments when one realizes one’s vacation is really starting to suck. when he was twelve, the young lindh saw spike lee’s rather hagiographic film biography about malcolm x. that began his fascination with islam. while a teenager, he used the evocative email [email protected] and made several postings about rap music on usenet. sometimes he pretended to be black, even having the nerve to “dis” dr. dre : $hort dog does hip hop no glory wack like dr dre and his made-up gangster stories sellout house nigga living honkey dory saying he’s broke in his own pool doing laps all these playground mc’s fall off like scabs skills disappear like alaka abracadab dr dre’s a disgrace selling out to the talcolm he’ll be left dead and naked in the outcome word to brother malcolm dre shirts and hat’s when will we see his cereal? so who’s the poseur there, anyway? i’m not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence, or cry at the abuse of the english language. when he was sixteen, he formally converted, beginning his fateful journey. meanwhile, his family situation was on shaky ground. his father turned gay , living part-time with his male lover , and eventually divorced. john began his world travels, twice venturing to yemen, both times for nearly a year. later, he stayed at a pakistani madrassa. in may 2001, he went to afghanistan to fight on behalf of the taliban. unfortunately for him, after september 11, american forces went to war with the taliban. he was captured on november 25 after his unit surrendered in kunduz. the cia questioned him, and he claimed to be an irishman. (that must have been an interesting conversation, perhaps “ach, begorrah, top o’ the mornin’ to ye!” presumably, pretending to be black again wouldn’t have gotten him very far.) shortly after, the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising , and lindh escaped. hundreds died, including mike spann, one of his interrogators. after that, he was recaptured and—following some rough treatment, not that i’m shedding any tears about it—questioned again. he announced defiantly that he wasn’t in the taliban, but rather al qaeda. his actions sealed his doom. fighting for the taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part. his actions after being captured were even dumber. what could he have done differently? in the beginning, he could’ve said he was interested in islam, and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad. then he could have lied and told them he was press-ganged into the taliban, and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen. he could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attempt—potentially sparing many lives on both sides—as well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself. had he given a helpful warning about the uprising, likely they would’ve concluded he was small fry and let him go. after that, he could’ve become the star of the daytime tv talk shows. then he could’ve given speeches on the anti-war circuit, helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really aren’t that bad or whatever. instead, he ended up faced with ten criminal charges, which could’ve meant three life sentences plus ninety years. finally getting smart, he copped a plea for twenty years, with the possibility of three off for good behavior. now, he’s in federal prison, making the news back in 2012 by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer . what went wrong? as bush the elder put it, lindh was “some misguided marin county hot-tubber.” later, he apologized profusely for the remark. still, i have to say that bush 41 was onto something with that one; all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts . things could’ve been different. lindh didn’t have to become a renegade. if he’d made other choices, he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society, rather than counting the days in a prison cell. still, his environment bears some responsibility for what he became. he was raised in the catholic faith, but a stronger grounding in it—as well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about islam to balance out the picture —might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad. (a liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all that’s bad. or has liberalism become too wishy-washy to assert its own values?) there wasn’t much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path; his mother converted to buddhism and his father left for the gay community. for that matter, if he had acquired an appreciation for good music—be it mozart or metallica—perhaps he wouldn’t have been so fascinated by irritating rap music. what kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be black and laughably accuses dr. dre of selling out? on that note, as for malcolm x, didn’t lindh have some cultural icons of his own? i have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own irish-american heritage. all this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an “ anything goes ” environment. islam speaks in absolutes, enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct, and they fight for what they believe in. (i can’t fault them too much for that, although i disagree with their theology and actions on many points.) going further, islam offers paradise for believers—promising seventy virgins to their martyrs—and eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned; there’s nothing wishy-washy about it. indeed, embracing radical islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the “anything goes” world view. i certainly don’t agree with lindh’s choices, but i can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism . this certainly isn’t the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy. jane fonda’s north vietnam adventure comes to mind; an action she now regrets. more recently, there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in iraq for their pal saddam. for all their posturing, none of them got themselves blown up over there. (leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified, 500 fewer social justice warriors would’ve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit.) then there’s the odd case of matthew todd miller , a californian who went to north korea, tore up his visa, and announced he was seeking political asylum. that one’s an iffy case though; later he said “i just wanted to speak to an ordinary north korean person about normal things.” kids these days… in summary don’t let this happen to our youth. they must not grow up culturally bereft. in times past, children were taught about their country’s heritage, instructed in their culture, and pride in their nation was instilled in them. it was a given that these were presented as good things. these days—at least in much of the western world—this isn’t happening. we can’t count on the educational system—and certainly the media—to do that any more. because of decades of cultural marxism , young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization. “all societies, beliefs, and ways of life are equal, except yours are terrible.” those who don’t see through that baloney end up rootless, alienated, and disconnected from their own culture. some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful. this is basically what social justice weenies think, something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue. this will have to change, of course. hopefully, the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural marxism are standing in the unemployment line. for now, we’ll have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing, and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity. teach them about their roots and why that’s important. don’t let the tv be your child’s babysitter. “anything goes” is not a standard by which to raise our youth. the shortest and most powerful explanation of trump's victory i have ever seen zach cartwrightzach cartwright | november 11, 2016 the democrats’ staggeringly piss-poor performance tuesday night resulting in donald trump’s victory can be summed up in one word: turnout. hillary clinton would have won had she focused her message more on appealing to white, working-class voters in rust belt states like iowa, michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, and wisconsin. as this new york times map of the 2012 election shows, president obama won all of those states in 2012. obama also won roughly 2.6 million more votes than hillary clinton won in 2016. donald trump’s narrow margin of victory in the electoral college was only possible by winning all of the aforementioned rust belt states . there was hardly any enthusiasm behind hillary clinton when examining exit poll results. in an analysis of reuters/ipsos exit polling, times writer sarah jaffe found several revealing trends showing why clinton was a poor choice for the democrats in terms of motivating voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots for their party’s nominee: 75 percent of respondents agreed “america needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” only slightly fewer agreed that “the american economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” the numbers bear out that argument — clinton’s turnout was lower than obama’s turnout in both 2008 and 2012, even though she still won the popular vote this year. no matter how you slice it, clinton wasn’t enough of a draw to make the difference, particularly in key states like florida, north carolina, pennsylvania, and wisconsin — states obama won in 2012. as the washington post reported, three traditionally blue states trump won in 2016 that obama won in 2012 — michigan, pennsylvania, and wisconsin — clinton got between 5 and 15 percent fewer votes than obama. the democratic primaries were a harbinger of things to come in a general election matchup featuring clinton and trump. as us uncut reported in march, hillary clinton’s victories in the march 1 super tuesday primaries all depended on voter turnout numbers lower than 2008 figures — the last time there was a contested democratic primary. in all seven states clinton won that day, each state had turnout anywhere between 4 percent and 50 percent lower than in 2008 . the data makes the argument all by itself. no amount of scapegoating heaped on jill stein supporters can explain hillary clinton losing traditional democratic strongholds that obama won not only once, but twice . in detroit, michigan, for example, hillary clinton got roughly 120,000 fewer votes than president obama in 2012. those votes made the difference in securing trump’s victory, as clinton lost michigan by roughly half that number. former pennsylvania governor ed rendell — one of the most senior officials within the democratic party apparatus — argued in a radio interview that even though hillary clinton was beloved by democratic party leadership, bernie sanders would have likely prevailed among the white, working-class rust belt constituency specifically due to his anti-establishment message. “it would be interesting to think of how bernie sanders would’ve done. bernie sanders would’ve lost a few republicans who voted for hillary because of some of his economic views but he would’ve fought donald pretty hard for those disaffected, angry, and frustrated workers,” rendell said on 1210 wpht in philadelphia. had the democratic party nominated a candidate more attuned to the mood of voters in one of the most anti-establishment elections in generations, turnout could have been much higher, and america would have averted trump’s victory. zach cartwright is an activist and author from richmond,

at the james weldon johnson school in east harlem, republican volunteers called 911 claiming clinton supporters were harassing them. volunteers canvassing and dropping off literature at houses monday for nevada republican senate candidate rep. joe heck were followed by supporters of hillary clinton, who then subsequently pulled down the literature, a source within the nevada republican party told the daily caller in an exclusive report. the staffers following them were wearing hrc buttons and hrc stickers. beyond following them, the hrc workers began going up to houses and illegally removing heck literature from the doors,” the nevada gop source said. “when the heck volunteers noticed this going on, they stopped to take pictures of the illegal action.” the source said that, “within a few minutes, more hrc campaign workers showed up. at this point, the heck volunteers began to feel threatened and called 911 to report hrc workers illegally removing campaign literature and harassing the heck volunteers.” reports like the case in nevada may seem minor to some, but those that have been called to pray over this election know that it only confirms the need for prayer. the kind of anger and even violence that can manifest during and after elections is something to be taken seriously. we have seen violence erupt during elections in other countries, and it certainly isn't something we

mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets click here or on the image below. if we had to sum it up in a single (albeit long) sentence, here it is: trump’s victory and the market’s subsequent turbulence signals a seismic shift in market leadership to commodity-led growth; u.s. imports of increasingly scarce and ever more costly commodities will rise drastically and so will inflation that a behind-the-curve fed will be helpless to curb; the eventual, inevitable upshot will be that commodity producers will become increasingly reluctant to take paper money for their ever scarcer resources and will want some more durable asset like, you guessed it, gold. that’s the case for gold in broad outline. now for the supporting evidence. let’s start with the reality that the u.s. has been blindly complacent about commodities, which will be required in massive amounts for the big infrastructure push trump has promised. the u.s. geological survey tracks around 65 vital commodities and minerals. for over 40 of them we import more than half our needs; for 25 (about 40 percent), we import at least 90 percent of our needs. we used to be far less dependent on other nations. at the beginning of this century we imported 90 percent or more of our needs for only a quarter of important commodities and imported 50 percent or more for about half. if you wonder why that’s a big deal, the problem is that those resources will be increasingly difficult and costly to obtain as they become scarcer. and scarcities are inevitable – in fact, they’ve begun. the chart of the index of raw industrials, the prices businesses pay in real time for the commodities they use (as opposed to futures trading) is revealing. remarkably, it shows that even at the nadir of the great recession, when capitalism’s very existence seemed precarious, the index stood 20 percent higher than its average during the 1990s. there is no way to explain this other than by realizing that commodities had become scarcer than in the previous decade. since the 2008 crash, global growth has been strong only in 2010 and the first half of 2011. in this period, the index far surpassed its 2008 high. after 2011, world growth retreated to recessionary levels until mid-2016, when just a hint of growth sent commodities almost to their pre-great recession peak. now with commodity-intensive infrastructure a worldwide imperative, they are destined to go well past their all-time highs. but what about gold? so why hasn’t gold gotten the message yet? one reason is that with gold rightfully seen more as a currency than a commodity, and with inflation still low, the market has some illusions that perhaps we’re going back to the 1990s goldilocks era of strong growth and low inflation. but the emergence of commodity scarcities will nix that possibility. the only reason the markets haven’t already caught on is one recalcitrant commodity: oil. with oil prices lagging, headline inflation has remained low and the fed still behaves as if it will remain low forever. but once oil gets into the act, headline inflation will jump and everything that requires oil – including virtually every other commodity – will jump as well. here is a look at a few key reasons why oil will rise. right now, with virtually every producer producing at full throttle, oil is about 750,000 barrels a day in oversupply. that will change either because opec at its meeting later this month acts to cut production or because increased demand overtakes the world’s ability to produce. above is a sign from the 1970s warning consumers about gas shortages opec will move to raise oil prices we think opec will act, and it won’t have to cut by much to reverse the current situation of oversupply. opec currently produces about 34 million barrels a day, a record amount, and is estimated to have no more than about 1 million barrels of excess supply – and even that could be overstating it. over the past five years the cartel’s production has averaged about 31 million barrels a day. at its peak in 2015 it was producing less than 33 million barrels. even returning to that previous peak would easily turn a glut into a deficit. and with the iea estimating demand in 2017 will grow by 1.2 million barrels a day – likely an underestimate in light of the push for infrastructure – it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that we’re headed for an oil deficit. that means big-time gains in oil prices and in inflation. if you think fracking will fill the gap, it won’t. even with three-digit oil, frackers will find it tough to add even half a million barrels of oil to current production. remember, fracking is resource-intensive, so its costs rise when commodity prices go up – and much of the recent gains in fracking productivity come from vast increases in the amount of sand and water used to frack the wells. gold liftoff! once oil joins the party, all the commodity pieces will be in place for gold to take off. remember, gold was far stronger than industrial commodities during the 2001 to 2008 boom and again during the second commodity upleg between 2009 and 2011. as for the fed, we don’t expect it to take a strong stand against inflation, not with a trump administration that has little fear of debt and that will likely view even high inflation as better for business than slow or even negative growth. protracted slow growth has fractured america and the world, and the 1970’s high inflation harmed wall street. not much of a choice for a populist administration. bottom line: the world has taken another giant leap to a future with little place for paper currencies and in which gold will become the monetary center. so stop worrying about gold’s current weakness and buy gold, which will be by far your best protection in a tumultuous future. while commodities and commodity-levered stocks will lead the market for the foreseeable future, gold (and other precious metals) will end up winning the race…as mentioned in the opener, kwn also released a completely separate audio interview today with dr. leeb covering the takedown in the gold and silver markets. t o listen to the

editorialunited states by oriental review the outcome of the 2016 presidential election will show that the american political system – as we have known it – will apparently cease to exist. trump is nothing like those republican pawns who, along with the puppets of the democratic party, have spent the last 40 years erecting the facade of american democracy. it really looks like he is ready to make good on the threat he made even prior to the republican national convention – to send millions of his supporters into the streets. today trump represents an entirely new party made up of half of the american electorate, and they are ready for action. and whatever the eventual political structure of this new model, this is what is shaping america’s present reality. moreover, this does not seem like such a unique situation. it rather appears to be the final chapter of some ancient story, in which the convoluted plotlines finally take shape and find resolution. the circumstances are increasingly reminiscent of 1860, when lincoln’s election so enraged the south that those states began agitating for secession. trump is today symbolic of a very real american tradition that during the civil war (1860-1865) ran headlong into american revolutionary liberalism for the first time. right up until world war i traditional american conservatism wore the guise of “isolationism.” prior to wwii it was known as “non-interventionism.” afterward, that movement attempted to use sen. joseph mccarthy to battle the left-liberal stranglehold. and in the 1960s it became the primary target of the “counter-cultural revolution.” richard nixon its last bastion was richard nixon , whose fall was the result of an unprecedented attack from the left-liberal press in 1974. and this is perhaps the example against which we should compare the present-day trump and his current fight. and by the way, the crimes of hillary clinton, who has failed to protect state secrets and has repeatedly been caught lying under oath, clearly outweigh the notorious watergate scandal that led to nixon’s forced resignation under threat of impeachment. but the liberal american media remains silent, as if nothing has happened. by all indications it is clear that we are standing before a truly epochal moment. but before turning to the future that might await us, let’s take a quick glance at the history of conflict between revolutionary liberalism and traditional white conservatism in the us. *** immediately after wwii, an attack on two fronts was launched by the party of “expansionism” (we’ll call it that). the soviet union and communism were designated the number one enemy. enemy number two (with less hype) was traditional american conservatism. the war against traditional “americanism” was waged by several intellectual fringe groups simultaneously. the country’s cultural and intellectual life was under the absolute control of a group known as the “ new york intellectuals .” literary criticism as well as all other aspects of the nation’s literary life was in the hands of this small group of literary curators who had emerged from the milieu of a trotskyist-communist magazine known as the partisan review ( pr ). no one could become a professional writer in the america of the 1950s and 1960s without being carefully screened by this sect. the foundational tenets of american political philosophy and sociology were composed by militants from the frankfurt school , which had been established during the interwar period in weimar germany and which moved to the us after the national socialists took power. here, retraining their sights from communist to liberal, they set out to design a “theory of totalitarianism” in addition to their concept of an “authoritarian personality” – both hostile to “democracy.” max shachtman the “new york intellectuals” and representatives of the frankfurt school became friends, and hannah arendt , for example, was an authoritative representative of both sects. this is where future neocons (norman podhoretz, eliot a. cohen, and irving kristol) gained their experience. the former leader of the trotskyist fourth international and godfather of the neocons, max shachtman , held a place of honor in the “family of intellectuals.” the anthropological school of franz boas and freudianism reigned over the worlds of psychology and sociology at that time. the boasian approach in psychology argued that genetic, national, and racial differences between individuals were of no importance (thus the concepts of “national culture” and “national community” were meaningless). psychoanalysis also became fashionable, which primarily aimed to supplant traditional church institutions and become a type of quasi-religion for the middle class. the common denominator linking all these movements was anti-fascism . did something look fishy in this? but the problem was that the traditional values of the nation, state, and family were all labeled “fascist.” from this standpoint, any white christian man aware of his cultural and national identity was potentially a “fascist.” kevin macdonald, a professor of psychology at california state university, analyzed in detail the seizure of america’s cultural, political, and mental landscape by these “liberal sects” in his brilliant book the culture of critique , writing: “the new york intellectuals, for example, developed ties with elite universities, particularly harvard, columbia, the university of chicago, and the university of california-berkeley, while psychoanalysis and anthropology became well entrenched throughout academia. “the moral and intellectual elite established by these movements dominated intellectual discourse during a critical period after world war ii and leading into the countercultural revolution of the 1960s.” it was precisely this intellectual milieu that spawned the countercultural revolution of the 1960s. riding the wave of these sentiments, the new immigration and nationality act was passed in 1965, encouraging this phenomenon and facilitating the integration of immigrants into us society. the architects of the law wanted to use the celebrated melting pot to “dilute” the “potentially fascist” descendants of european immigrants by making use of new ethno-cultural elements. the 60s revolution opened the door to the american political establishment to representatives from both wings of the expansionist “party” – the neo-liberals and the neo-conservatives. besieged by the left-liberal press in 1974, richard nixon resigned under threat of impeachment. in the same year the us congress passed the jackson-vanik amendment (drafted by richard perle ), which emerged as a symbol of the country’s “new political agenda” – economic war against the soviet union using sanctions and boycotts. at that same time the “hippie generation” was joining the democratic party on the coattails of senator george mcgovern’s campaign . and that was when bill clinton’s smiling countenance first emerged on the us political horizon. and the future neo-conservatives (at that time still disciples of the democratic hawk henry “scoop” jackson) began to slowly edge in the direction of the republicans. «if there is any doubt about the power of your ideas, just look at the number of members of the center that have been appointed to posts in this administration -especially in the department of defense- to dispel that doubt». donald rumsfeld, secretary of defense, september 5, 2002 in 1976, mr. rumsfeld and his fellow neo-conservatives resurrected the committee on the present danger , an inter-party club for political hawks whose goal became the launch of an all-out propaganda war against the ussr. former trotskyists and followers of max shachtman (kristol, podhoretz, and jeane kirkpatrick) and advisers to sen. henry jackson (paul wolfowitz, perle, elliott abrams, charles horner, and douglas feith) joined donald rumsfeld, dick cheney, and other “christian” politicians with the intention of launching a “campaign to transform the world.” this is where the neocons’ “nonpartisan ideology” originated. and eventually today’s “inalterable us government” hatched from this egg. american politics began to acquire its current shape during the reagan era. in economics this was seen in the policy of neoliberalism (politics waged in the interests of big financial capital) and in foreign policy – in a strategy consisting of “holy war against the forces of evil.” the nixon-kissinger tradition of foreign policy (which viewed the soviet union and china as a normal countries with which is essential to find common ground) was entirely abandoned. the collapse of the ussr was a sign of the onset of the final phase of the “neocon revolution.” at that point their protégé, francis fukuyama, announced the “end of history.” *** as the years passed, the influence of the neo-conservatives (in politics) and neoliberals (in economics) only expanded. through all manner of committees, foundations, “think tanks,” etc., the students of milton friedman and leo strauss (from the departments of economics and political science at the university of chicago) penetrated ever more deeply into the inner workings of the washington power machine. the apotheosis of this expansion was the presidency of george w. bush, during which the neocons, having seized the primary instruments of power in the white house, were able to plunge the country into the folly of a war in the middle east. by the end of the bush presidency this clique was the object of universal hatred throughout the us. that’s why the middle-ground, innocuous figure of barack obama, a democrat, was able to move into the white house for the next eight years. the neocons stepped down from their central rostrums of power and returned to their “influential committees.” it is likely that this election was intended to facilitate the triumphant return of the neoconservative-neoliberal paradigm all wrapped up in “new packaging.” for various reasons, the decision was made to assign this role to hillary clinton. but it seems that at the most critical moment the flimsy packaging ripped open … what happened? why is this clique’s triumphant return to power erupting in massive scandal this time around? probably because we are living in an era during which much that was mysterious is suddenly becoming clear. probably because trump’s “silent majority” suddenly saw before them someone they had been waiting for for a long time – a man ready to defend their interests. perhaps also it is because the middle class is choking on its growing exasperation with the “elite caste” occupying its native country. and it finally became clear to the sober-minded american patriots in law enforcement that the return to power of the people responsible for the current global chaos could be a big threat to the us and rest of the world. because, in the end, everyone has children and no one wants a new world war. how will this new conservative revolt against the elite end? will trump manage to “drain the swamp of washington, dc” as he has promised, or he will end up as the system’s next victim? very soon we can finally get an answer to these questions. related posts trump’s campaign for celebrity neal gablertrump’s campaign for celebrity like junk food, will trump leave us empty and wanting more? by neal gabler posted on november 1, 2016 by neal gabler it is a cliché by now that donald trump has run a reality show campaign—a series of gaffes, surprises, outrages, weirdnesses, explosions, revelations, and just every other ingredient that comprise the popular tv genre of faux authenticity. on reality tv, the subjects are seldom artists or entertainers or high achievers in any field. they are personalities. their roles are their lives, which creates a möbius strip. what do the kardashians actually do besides being on their show, which has, of course, generated all sorts of commercial opportunities that almost make it seem as if they are doing something? what is their talent, other than the talent for self-promotion? all of this was anticipated 54 years ago by historian daniel boorstin in the image , in which he defined a celebrity as someone who is known for being well-known. in a previous post , i discussed how this applied to trump, who seems a hollow man except for his fame. but i am not sure that boorstin’s tautology, clever as it is, is really accurate. i would submit that celebrity isn’t a status, nor is it a media anointment. i think celebrity is actually a narrative form played out in the medium of life and then broadcast by the traditional and now social media. one earns celebrity—to the extent that you can call it earned—by keeping one’s narrative going. you lose your celebrity not when you lose fame or attention, your well-known-ness, but when you lose your narrative, which is what got you the attention in the first place. donald trump is the first celebrity candidate in both boorstin’s sense and mine—boorstin’s because trump is less a builder of edifices than a slapper-of-his-name-on-other-people’s edifices. he is literally known for being well-known. and in mine because trump has spent the better part of his life providing narratives to the press to feed its insatiable appetite for gossip and his desire for attention. there are many ways in which trump is a unique presidential aspirant, but chief among them may be this: he is the first candidate who ran for president to feed his celebrity. the entire campaign is a plot point—a means to a larger end, which is not the presidency, but keeping his celebrity afloat. relevance is an issue for all of us, but especially for a 70-year-old man who is accustomed to the spotlight. i thought of this when the new york times ran two pieces this week. one was the first of a series based on interviews with trump conducted by biographer michael d’antonio and given to the times by him. what the interviews reveal is that trump’s primary obsession is a fear of losing his fame. in the interviews trump reviles arsenio hall , a former talk show host and one-time celebrity apprentice contestant . “dead as a doornail. dead as dog meat,” trump eulogized. the other article that struck me was one about how trump used appearances on tv shows and in films as the times piece about trump’s hollywood connections tells it, he began talking about running for president as early as 1988. why? trump didn’t have any overriding sense of national mission. he doesn’t have one even now. clearly, his ongoing, three-decades-long flirtation with the presidency was just a plot twist—a way of juicing the narrative when it was flagging. in that sense, it was no different than his affair with marla maples, his feud with rosie o’donnell, his nonstop lawsuits and everything else. the presidency was a publicity stunt. it still is. viewed that way, nearly everything trump does, politics, as i have written many times, has long been integrated with entertainment. the devices of the latter serve the ends of the former, and this has especially served conservatives: the x-files fed conservative paranoia, 24 this post was first published on billmoyers.com neal gabler is an author of five books and

proposes to man his cabinet (whether allegedly or actually) will pass their litmus test. they will be sure to find fault with every one of his selections or rumored selections, and then revel in their own “brilliance” by telling us in their articles, videos and posts that they warned us. essentially, trump’s alt-media critics are doing the job of the msm, who on the very next day after trump won the election went on a tear about how he was planning on staffing his cabinet with insiders. it’s clear that those who engage in this sort of “reporting” are intent on disrupting trump’s support base by giving the impression that he is defaulting on his promises and engaging in business as usual. i’m dubious of anyone who engages in perpetual rumor and speculation by relentlessly parroting names that are circulating about as part of an organized disinfo campaign. when the choices are made and announced, then we could fairly engage in worthy critique if need be. every one of us is bound to find fault with at least someone in his cabinet. this is all completely normal because no reasonable person ever expected that his choices would be saints who were free of all unsavory baggage. but the key word here is reasonable, something that is sorely lacking these days. in so far as the aftermath of the election, the msm seriously miscalculated the intelligence of the american people in the days following the election. they thought that by giving the pampered protesters carte blanche coverage, their support base would grow beyond all proportions as a mass anti-trump movement swept the nation. instead, the shattered hearts of the coddled candy-asses who lack the basic fortitude to handle defeat of any kind, has been laid bare for all too see. they are the poster children of everything that is wrong with the deviant and dysfunctional left in the us. the purple revolution is backfiring miserably as the nation is waking up to the reality that a minority of snot-nosed deplorables are attempting to rip the country apart at the seams. it ain’t gonna fly, no matter how much cash massa soros pumps into their basket. no, the left isn’t quite dead yet, but it’s gasping for air. the cat’s out of the bag now, and the blowback that will come down the pike in the following months will leave no doubt as to what side of history this gaggle of miscreants will end up on when the final chapter is written. ed_b november 20, 2016 at 6:55 pm · reply @guido agreed. the back-stabbing has commenced and all the sore losers in our country are lining up to receive free blades from their masters. perhaps it is they who could use some time in a “re-education camp”? it’s now clear all with an iq above room temp that the msm have completely sold their credibility for political access and favors, which leaves them with nothing of any value to sell. but all this is ok. their complaining and whining will pale to insignificance when trump succeeds with various promises he’s made. not that he can keep them all, of course, but the general direction in which he moves will be a substantial improvement over the past 8 years. speaking of idiots, lol… did you see where obama was telling trump that he “needs to be tough with the russians”? i almost choked on my morning coffee over that one. the dish rag is counseling the pit bull on how to be tough! lol!! guido november 20, 2016 at 7:30 pm · reply ed, did you ever see that video where barry is pretending to workout with weights? tough? not quite. what about that one where he’s throwing the first pitch at a major league ballgame? not exactly my idea of toughness. compare this pansy to footage of vlad engaging in the martial arts, shooting firearms, riding horseback shirtless, or hobnobbing with that outlaw biker club in russia (some of whose members volunteered to fight with the pro-russian resistance in ukraine after the us-led coup). granted, it’s all theater, but it does get the point across in no uncertain terms. 8 years of barry has been too much to take, but just think of the entire generation of numbskulls and meatheads who not only went through their formidable years while this fool played pretend at the white house, but actually cite him as one of their top influences and heroes. it’s no wonder these wanna-be community organizers and communist revolutionaries are prancing around the streets at professional protests chanting the trendiest slogans of the week. oh well, at least mommy and daddy have a bit of free time to themselves while the kiddies are away playing dress-up. but they’ll be back to the basement soon enough. videoctr november 19, 2016 at 6:37 am · reply i like the idea of calling the alt-media, new media instead. i also like the idea suggested in this

espoused a core premise of modernism , when a person physiologically internalizes this concept , the process of natural or organic , if you will , understanding is diminished. put hand in fire – hot it burns- etc . this psychological meme ( what is called modernism) is man made , a product of what is referred to as the “enlightenment” period historically . the names of the practitioners of this false meme is recorded historical fact , as well the reason for the development of, and the spread of. my challenge for you is to search human history for societies that practiced infanticide as well societies that practiced sodomy , were there cultures that practiced both at the same time ? or did one diminish and the other take over , or variations such as open human murder , referred to as human sacrifice. what was the out come of these cultures ? millicent november 19, 2016 at 10:31 am · reply i decided to make a project of tracking some of the dumbest statements made on this blog… when i saw glitter make the “call” for december 2016 pm price points of $100 silver and $3500 gold back in february of 2016 i knew that i had a winner. december will come & go and his “call” will not be even remotely close. eric will keep yammering his psycho babble about books, how i’m stupid, etc., etc. but the the fact remains that glitter did not have a clue about what he was predicting and somehow i will be blamed for calling him out and telling him he was a moron for making that “call”. eric keeps asking why i say that he is being conned. eric is so hopelessly immersed in the con that he has become a part of it and will probably never wake up to the fact. eric millicent, you are stupid. i’m sorry i have to be the one to tell you. now can you at least have a little credibility and tell me what the con is? if you want to make a point, provide some information. monetary base and fed’s balance sheet increased 5 fold. there’s no good reason why the gold price won’t increase by at least the same amount. don’t forget to remember my speculative prediction of $2500 gold/$60-$75 silver by end of 2017. too bad you missed my trump wins in a landslide if there is an election. nailed

destacadas del debate de investidura resumimos la agitada jornada de hoy en el congreso sesión de investidura mariano rajoy no ha conseguido ser investido presidente en la primera votación a causa del rotundo “no” del psoe. una actuación muy poco creíble por parte de la bancada socialista, sobreactuada incluso, como cuando rafael hernando, portavoz socialista, se ha levantado de su escaño para votar y, justo después de hacerlo, le ha tirado un vaso de agua a la cara a rajoy y ha fingido un desmayo. fuentes del congreso aseguran que hernando ha guiñado el ojo a rajoy en un par de ocasiones para tranquilizar al candidato a la presidencia. recopilamos a continuación algunos de los momentos más importantes de la jornada. mariano rajoy (pp) “he aceptado el encargo del rey para presentarme a la investidura porque, oigan, es el rey”. “hemos ganado dos veces las elecciones, fácilmente. ¿quieren que gane otra más? cuando haga falta, yo no tengo prisa”. “algo le pasa a cristiano. no está fino. desde el partido popular intentaremos solucionarlo”. “hace tres días yo estaba en el paro. y mírenme. empieza la regeneración del empleo en españa”. “estoy aprendiendo twitter, ya sigo a cristiano ronaldo”. “en twitter soy @marianocrystal y me gustaría que me hicieran ‘hashtag’ sus señorías”. (a pablo iglesias, tras la alusión a los sms) “también he aprendido a usar los sms mejor, como usted dice, aunque siempre llamo después para comprobar que han llegado”. (a españa) “eres mía. sólo mía. miísima. más mía no puedes ser. y no porque yo te lo diga, sino porque así lo has decidido tú. mía. sólo mía. miísima. esa mía tan tuya de la que me he enamorado”. “sigan diciendo sus cosas y vayamos alargando debates estériles. ustedes, y sólo ustedes, serán los responsables de eliminar el puente a todos los diputados”. (a joan tardà) “oiga, se lo diré hasta con cariño, han hecho ustedes llorar a cristiano”. antonio hernando (psoe) “no le pondremos las cosas fáciles al pp. sin ir más lejos: hoy he aparcado el coche muy pegadito al de soraya. a ver cómo entra luego”. “vamos a hacer de oposición, señor rajoy, hágase a la idea. mal empezaríamos con artimañas como los vetos y los decretos […] sea consciente, señor rajoy, de que nos vamos a hacer respetar como oposición. no aprobaremos nada, absolutamente nada de lo que usted diga a la primera, lo haremos a la segunda”. “nos vamos a hacer respetar como oposición. los ciudadanos nos exigen que les controlemos. y lo haremos sin gritar ni utilizar la demagogia y con la camisa metida por dentro, que es algo que los españoles aprecian (en referencia a podemos)”. “nos sobran razones para no confiar en usted, pero no hay razón para mantener el bloqueo político y llevar a los españoles a nuevas elecciones, sólo nos jugamos el país y además no tenemos candidato en el psoe”. “somos de izquierdas, no les quepa ninguna duda. y seguiremos cantando la internacional con orgullo. siempre y cuando la internacional tenga papeles y esté en una situación regulada”. (a la salida de la cámara, tras la pregunta de un periodista) “pedro sánchez y yo somos buenos amigos. es más: este sábado, en la segunda votación, cantaremos ‘escondidos’. yo haré de bisbal”. pablo iglesias (podemos) “hay aquí mucho delincuente potencial. lo sé porque me lo han dicho los precogs”. “mírenme a los ojos y díganme que no les doy miedo”. “me debo al honor de mi patria, de los ciudadanos de mi país y de la asociación de rol ‘sword of carabanchel’ que saludo desde aquí”. “supongo que albert rivera tendrá que buscar en google algún torrent de la película del 23-f pero yo se la puedo pasar en un pen”. “somos la única oposición real al pp. errejón mariquita. nuestra única misión es hacer frente a rajoy. íñigo, tonto. no tengan ni una duda de que nada ni nadie nos distraerá. gafotas cuatroojos”. (a ferreras) “ferreras, no me esperes para cenar, que esto va para largo”. albert rivera (ciudadanos) “¡christian! ¡que no te chivaste de mi cara!” “¡que te comiste 10 en una noche y no me diste ni media! ¡y no me diste ni mierda!” “sí, el chuky de cieza, cuando quieras bajas a buscarme, que tengo yo que engancharte por la banda”. “gilipollas”. “te tengo que reventar, literalmente”. “que te chivaste a tu ma, a mi ma, te chivaste a la… ¡ya verás!” “¿sabes lo que tengo ahí en mi coche? ¿quieres verlo? ¿quieres sentirlo en el pecho?” (a iglesias) “¿ves los agujeros del techo? eso sí que… ahí la guardia civil entrando y ¡pam! ¡pam! eso sí es un golpe de estado… no hay que usar la palabra a la ligera. el que la saca para enseñarla es un parguela”. (a iglesias) “así… ¡ñeeepam!” joan tardà (erc) “ya que el señor rivera ha usado el catalán entiendo que yo también puedo usarlo. el poble català veié una gran lluminària i cregué que la vida li mancava; mes, abans de perdre del tot la coneixença, encara sentí caure-li al damunt i enfonsar-se en ses carns la grapa peluda i alenada roent de la fera, senyor rajoy.” “té nyirvis, senyor rajoy? mes l’encís ja estava romput i la terra, bella i tot com suara, no logrà revifar-li el caliu d’aquell primer anhel”. “li dic que matarem el llop”. pedro sánchez (psoe) “perdona, ¿está ocupado este escaño? ah, vale… no, no, ya sigo buscando”. “oye, ¿está libre este escaño? ah… bueno, si le estás guardando el sitio a alguien, poniendo las chaquetas encima, tranquila. chao”. ana pastor, presidenta del congreso “por favor, silencio. señores del psoe, un minuto de abstención. ¡de atención!” confusing jihad with hirabah won't build a more peaceful world hugh escotweet widget by hugh esco the author, a reader and colleague of bar, offers a corrective to our use of the word “jihad,” a term that, in “an islamic conception, has nothing to do with ‘holy war.’” in this “appeal,” mr. esco warns: “when we fail to interrupt this abuse of human language, we lend support to registration programs and internment camps, to islamaphobic attacks and imperial wars of aggression.” confusing jihad with hirabah won't build a more peaceful world by hugh esco “no one seems to use of phrases like ‘christian terrorists,’ although there is plenty of evidence in our history and contemporary experience to support the use of such a phrase.” black agenda report led the way by banning the perjorative use of “illegal” to describe workers in this country without documentation. this publication did so in an article years ago comparing its use to that of the n-word. many other media outlets including those in the mainstream have since followed suit, so that these days the word is only heard in those venues intent on expressing their contempt for our fellow workers in this divisive way. this is my appeal that black agenda report and the readers who look to this publication for thought-leadership decide for ourselves that fox news does not need our help creating a hostile world for our muslim neighbors who respect a messenger who in his final sermon instructed the faithful, \"treat others justly so that no one will be unjust to you.\" fringe white supremacist groups have long shown a willingness to use violence to advance their political agenda and to justify their tactics by misquoting the bible and claiming a christian identity. still no one seems to paint all christians as equally heinous, to treat their claims of christian faith with any seriousness or to adopt the widespeard use of phrases like “christian terrorists,” although there is plenty of evidence in our history and contemporary experience to support the use of such a phrase. yet it serves the monied interests who profit from war to create fear by conflating the actions and strategies of small sectarian militias who misquote the quran to advance their secular agenda with the beliefs of 1.6 billion muslims who actually seek to practice its precepts. “the arabic word ‘jihad’ most often translates as ‘struggle.’” for muslims around the world an islamic conception of jihad has nothing to do with “holy war,” a concept put forward in 1095 by the catholic pope urban ii to justify the crusades against muslims. the arabic word most often translates as “struggle,” and is used forty-one times in the quran, thirty-one times to speak of what the context reveals is a “jihad al-nafs,” or an inner struggle in the path of the divine, what islamic scholars have called “the greater jihad.” it is the sort of lifetime commitment to personal integrity that supports being good partners to spouses, good parents to children, good neighbors, to be civically engaged to create a better world for our communities. the quran includes ten references to “jihad al-qital,” referred to as the “lesser jihad” by the scholars and theologians. jihad al-qital is an external militant struggle, ordained by legitimate civil authorities and constrained by rules-of-engagement respecting the distinctions between combatants and others. it includes an expectation that the lives of captured combatants will be spared. jihad al-qital bears more in common with the christian concept of just-war, than with the scorched earth policies of the crusades which burned the libraries of byzantium, or the jewish tribes annihilation of all the indigenous peoples of canaan, along with their livestock and shrines. we create a communications disconnect when we turn jihad into a pejorative, one where muslims and non-muslims wind up talking past each other. “we'd never let timothy mcveigh define christianity for us. ” we also empower al-qaida and isis and similar organizations and their allies among the elites of the united states, when we let them appropriate this key islamic concept to describe their terrorist activities. we'd never let timothy mcveigh define christianity for us. when we fail to interrupt this abuse of human language, this hate speech, this disrespect for the faith of 1% of our fellow us citizens and roughly a quarter of our global neighbors, we first show our ignorance but worse share responsibility for creating an atmosphere which lends support to the attacks being suffered on a regular basis by our muslim neighbors, both here at home and abroad. we lend support to registration programs and internment camps, to islamaphobic attacks and imperial wars of aggression. if we need an arabic word to describe terrorism, that word would be hirabah, which translates as “unlawful warfare.” nuclear blackmail is hirabah. drone strikes are hirabah. cluster munitions are hirabah. white phosphorous is hirabah. wars of imperialism, aggression and occupation are hirabah. wars for oil are hirabah. and distorting language to tell people that words mean the opposite of what they mean is also a form of cultural warfare, and ought to be unlawful, but is perpetrated daily by elected officials, agencies of our own government, the war industry funded think tanks, fox-news and other islamophobes in the media. sectarian militias and fox news ought not be given the power to redefine the 'sixth' pillar of islam for the non-muslim world. “wars of imperialism, aggression and occupation are ‘hirabah.’” and they certainly do not need our help doing it. in that final sermon referenced above, the muslim prophet also prohibited usurious loans and instructed those with accumulated wealth to give every year to the state specified percentages for distribution to the needy. no wonder the disaster capitalists want us to be afraid of our muslim neighbors. if fearing our neighbors serves the interests of disaster capitalists, it is highly unlikely to do us any good. jihad, even in its lower form, shows its practitioners to be more civilized that the imperial purposes to which our tax dollars are put in imperial wars of aggression and occupation. jihad al-nafs is an islamic principle to which all the worlds' people, with or without faith, should aspire. so-called 'jihadist terrorist' is an oxymoron, one which creates a disconnect for those who understand arabic and islamic teachings. we ought to say 'sectarian militia' when that is what we mean. doing so is as essential to our learning to respect our immigrant neighbors as was our rejection of the pejorative use of 'illegal'. getting the language right is a key early step to creating peace with our muslim neighbors in the global community. it will help us take the next step of ending our imperial occupations. fox news is not a legitimate source for a vocabulary useful to our struggle, our jihad for a just future. but respect for the faiths of others can move us in the right direction. hugh esco is a

liberal journalists smear bannon cliff kincaid lazy liberal journalists smear bannon lazy liberal journalists smear bannon november 16, 2016, 1:37 pm by cliff kincaid leave a comment 0 accuracy in media media bias won’t let up just because the liberal media were humiliated on november 8. the bias is now being directed at the president-elect’s conservative appointments. on monday night’s cbs evening news, anchor scott pelley proclaimed that the southern poverty law center had declared that donald j. trump’s campaign ceo stephen bannon “has no business being in the white house.” bannon was named as chief strategist and counselor. in fact, the southern poverty law center (splc) has no business being cited as a credible source by any responsible news organization. it smears conservatives for profit, diverting attention from real domestic threats, such as the marxist extremists currently demonstrating against trump in the streets and threatening to disrupt his inauguration. many of the demonstrators are from the answer coalition , an outgrowth of the pro-north korea marxist-leninist workers world party. but don’t expect to get any information about the answer coalition from the splc. in fact, the splc is in bed with communists of all kinds, having participated in the notorious left forum held in new york city earlier this year. we noted at the time that the event featured “an assortment of communists, 9/11 truthers, pro-palestinian and anti-israel activists, and other extremists.” even more troubling, splc president and ceo richard cohen was a member of the “ countering violent extremism working group ” of the department of homeland security in 2010. it is possible that cohen, in this capacity, was able to get access to classified information, and that the splc, in turn, shared its erroneous data on conservative opponents of the obama administration with federal law enforcement agencies. the attacks on bannon stem from his leadership of the news site, breitbart news , a popular source of alternative news and information which was strongly pro-trump during the campaign. on occasion, the site features some unorthodox conservative views that bannon’s critics have tried to pin on him. the site was named for andrew breitbart, who pioneered new and effective ways to undermine the left. one of his disciples, jeremy segal, did a video exposing democratic rep. danny k. davis (il) being honored at the communist party u.s.a.’s headquarters in chicago for a lifetime of “inspiring leadership.” lazy liberal journalists would rather cite the splc as authoritative without having to bother to investigate how the group has been exposed by such investigative reporters on the left as ken silverstein. at one time, notes silverstein , the group did some good work against racist hate groups. but later, in order to expand its business model and make more money, it expanded the “hate” label to mainstream conservative organizations. it has accumulated $300 million in a reserve fund and has become “one of the most profitable charities in the country,” with its top officials getting membership in the so-called financial elite one percent. this journalist was named a member of the “radical right,” a designation then transformed into a charge of “islamophobia” by the council on american-islamic relations (cair). the accusations are designed to silence first amendment rights and discourage the media from going to conservative sources for news, information and commentary. before pelley uncritically cited the splc, kate snow was on msnbc talking about how trump’s stand against illegal immigration was similar to that of the secretary of state of kansas, kris kobach. she said kobach had given “support” to the social contract press, which she described as a “hate group” designated by the southern poverty law center. the social contract press rebuts all of the accusations, while noting that the splc’s $300 million cash hoard “rivals that of [the] clinton foundation.” it was the social contract press which published one of silverstein’s articles exposing the splc. indeed, silverstein’s exposé was just one section of a major report the social contract press published in 2010 that examined the splc’s strategy and tactics. yet, it’s bannon who is being accused of being an extremist. the washington post admits there’s no real evidence behind the allegation, making it just another smear picked up by most of the media without adequate checking or verification. what we are witnessing in the faux outrage against bannon is a fear that the trump administration and the new republican congress will get back to the business of monitoring real domestic threats. for example, trump adviser walid phares has already indicated that the president-elect will back a bill, the muslim brotherhood terrorist designation act, which could lead to an investigation of the council on american-islamic relations. trevor loudon, the producer of the new film, “ enemies within ,” says the muslim brotherhood terrorist designation act could be supplemented by the house and senate bringing back committees or subcommittees devoted to exposing internal security problems, also known as un-american activities. a member of congress exposed in the film for his ties to the muslim brotherhood is rep. keith ellison (d-mn) , who is running for chairman of the democratic national committee. giant lynx makes the most adorable sound, whenever his human rubs his face dikran arakelian (noreply@blogger.com)share on facebook when

70 19 0 1 mohsen abdelmoumen : according to you, when we see the numerous demonstrations anti-trump in the united states after the election of donald trump at the presidency, are we witnessing a colored revolution? wayne madsen: it is classic soros-funded color revolution. soros is financing moveon.org, black lives matter, demos, and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators. in your very relevant books devoted to george soros: “soros: quantum of chaos”, you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world. from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable? soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person, evelyn de rothschild, along with his family. they are all the true puppet masters of the world. soros remains a major element in the anti-trump device. can trump resist him? more... disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won, now what? will america survive the next 4 years? defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the soros-rothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump. can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions? secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region. in your book “ isis is us - the shocking truth behind the army of terror”, you detail the relations between the usa and isis/daesh. what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail? trump's national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign. my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama. you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un. aren't the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the un's resolutions? the clintons received at least $12 million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to morocco's agenda, which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the \"southern province.\" morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegally-occupied territories. according to your diverse very interesting analysis, can we assert that the world government or the false prophets of the new world order are the real decision-makers of this world? i mentioned a few already, soros/rothschild. others are the bilderbergs, bohemian club, and the council on foreign relations and their counterparts. you know very well some american intelligence agencies like the nsa. do these intelligence agencies serve the us' interests or, rather, the oligarchy's interests? the cia has always served the interests of wall street. nsa now serves the interests of the global security network it leads. you were an officer in the us navy. was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before? before. i was an fbi-navy whistleblower in 1982 and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reagan-bush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in 1988-89. my whistleblowing cost me my navy career, however, and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs. in the recent us election, we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls. didn't one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes? don't we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product, globalization? 99 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton. many alternative news sources supported trump. we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media, of which waynemadsenreport.com has been prominent since its founding in 2005. snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon, both of which serve the interests of the world's oligarchic caste. what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg? what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft, apple, google, facebook, and major telecommunications companies. it is much greater than even snowden's documents describe. the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings. how all these truths have been hidden? the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events. i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media. how do you explain that we, who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste, are called conspiracy theorists? is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed? the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mid-1960s to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy. it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into iran-contra, 9/11, and other deep state crimes. your book “ the star and the sword ” is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia. you claim that they organize false flag attacks, including the 9/11. what is the origin and nature of this israeli-saudi strategic alliance? do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia? do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isn't due to the weight of the lobby zionist? the zionist-wahhabi/saudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba. the relationship has always been close, except for the time of king faisal, who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative. do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do? if so, how do you live it? i was forced to move my domicile from washington because the outgoing obama administration put pressure on some media organizations i did work for. these included rt (contributor agreement canceled) and al jazeera america (which is now defunct). the fbi entered my apartment in washington at least twice and i've had three visits by them at my new home in florida. i was informed of 3 personal threats in washington. i ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press. are you optimistic or do you think that the satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos? as with cockroaches, which detest light, the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine. light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so. interview realized by mohsen abdelmoumen who is wayne madsen? wayne madsen is an american journalist,

november 10th, 2016. lesseroftwoevilism anonymous2016 presidential campaign by matt sedillo hillary clinton is, no doubt, a threat to life on earth. but the duopoly electoral system is a menagerie of warmongers. “the response to the white nationalism of donald trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks.” barack obama has proven an awesomely prolific war maker. bernie sanders is no peacenik. “it is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question.” lesseroftwoevilism by matt sedillo “ so long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood.” the loathsome and shameless hypocrisy of the democratic party and the doctrine of lesseroftwoevilism has been laid bare this political season. this same democratic party that unquestionably rigged the primaries against the left-leaning bernie sanders campaign is now selling itself to the public as the savior of the downtrodden from the threat of an uber right wing candidate. hillary clinton at this point in her election run appears to be making no promises to the public other than to not to physically morph into donald trump during her coronation come election day. lesseroftwoevilism is a bankrupt political ideology and the means by which the democratic party deadens any inkling towards decency or rational self interest that may lay dormant in the american electorate. hillary clinton and the democratic party intend to use the platform of \"at least not being donald trump\" to install the most despised democratic candidate in a generation into the white house. it is indeed horrifying that a straight up eugenicist billionaire who brags about sexual assaulting women won the republican primary. it is terrifying that the cult leader of a white nationalist zombie apocalypse has gotten this far through the electoral process. “there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than hillary clinton.” the country is polarizing and it is terrifying to see that much of it is polarizing in the direction of donald trump whose campaign is defined by phrases like “make america great again” quickly followed by “mexico will pay.” much of the country is also polarized in the direction of bernie sanders. it was the political apparatus of the democratic party, not the republicans, that prevented these two competing visions from standing before the american public. setting aside the fact, for a moment, that we don't live in a democracy, it must be noted that lesseroftwoevilism in american politics is an ideology by americans for americans. hillary clinton, donald trump, and bernie sanders are all advocates of the us war machine. if any of these three warlords were to sit in the seat of power children in far off lands would still be bombed in their sleep and be reported on as collateral damage. hillary clinton is the most bloodthirsty advocate for murder and mayhem in a political system that thrives upon such practices. when it comes to dropping bombs, obliterating nations or possibly igniting a nuclear winter there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than hillary clinton. rainbow coalition of hawks far beyond a “basket of deplorables,” the 2016 republican national convention was a ghastly horror show of the most reactionary, bigoted elements of american political culture. less than esteemed actor scott baio captured the mood when he proclaimed, “so of course let’s make america great again, but let’s make america america again.” that largely captured the theme of the proceedings and most speeches were some variation upon that theme. the democrats in response sought to make their convention a big tent of peoples, ideas and movements. and indeed from the spontaneous chants of “black lives matter” to tim kaine leading a chant of “si se puede” to eva longoria reminding the audience “we didn’t cross the borders the borders crossed us” to michelle obama letting the thousands in attendance and the millions watching at home know that slave labor built the white house and the country, from sebastian de la cruz singing the national anthem in full mariachi garb to the khan family holding a copy of the constitution, the democratic national convention did present itself as a stark contrast to what the gop was offering. the theme of inclusion ran high and, indeed, current president barack obama made his call for strength in unity, explicitly saying “and most of all i see americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe we are stronger together, black white, latino, asian, native american, young, old, gay, straight, men, women, folks with different abilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big bold country that we love.” one flag to rule them all. “america the greatest and most diverse nation on earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. ” general john allen, standing before a multi ethnic group of people continued upon this theme and made the connection between a more inclusive union and explicit projection of american might “every american, in uniform or out, in the white house or at home, must be a force for unity in america, for a vision that includes all of us: every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, every gender orientation – all of us together pursuing our common values. “from the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to america as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we are the greatest country on this planet. “so we stand before you tonight to endorse hillary clinton for president of the united states of america.” the message could not be clearer. sorry donald trump, we are all americans here. no apologies rest of the world, america the greatest and most diverse nation on earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. the response to the white nationalism of donald trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks as chiefly embodied in the persons of barrack obama and hillary clinton. hillary clinton: the obliterator of nations hillary clinton is a war criminal. so is john kerry. so is condoleezza rice. so are colin powell and madeleine albright. the secretary of state in an imperialist nation is the immediate manager of the projected might of the empire they represent. hillary clinton is known to be a war hawk for much the same reason donald trump is known as a white nationalist. she is blatant and crass about it. “we came. we saw. he died” – hillary clinton on the assassination of ghadaffi “in the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them” – hillary clinton speaking of obliteration of 75 million iranians. for much of the past few months the clinton campaign have bemoaned a russian conspiracy to reveal the words that hillary clinton actually wrote and thereby influence the american election. hillary clinton’s neo-mcarthyite cold war against her own words and general war talk on russia should come as no surprise to anyone paying any attention. she was hawkish on russia in their land dispute with georgia over ossetia, even going so far as to arm the georgian government in 2010 less than two years after the conflict. she was warlike on the conflict in the ukraine, promising ukrainian government officials as recent as september of this year to stand with them against “russian aggression.” “a clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class.” this is the talk of someone prepared for a nuclear apocalypse. it should be mentioned, however, that obama has also dialed up his anti russian rhetoric, as has tim kaine, as has mike pence. it is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question. ultimately a clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class. if she wants war it is a reflection of their desire for war. if they want the bombs to fall then death will rain from the sky. so long as they hold power they shall exercise it. so long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood, because there truly is no alternative. because ultimately, this is about clinton and then again it isn’t. and this is about the democrats and then again it isn’t. this is about the us and this is about war. hillary clinton is a 2016 warlord. war is a racket. and so is this god damn election. matt sedillo can be contacted at [email protected] . another powerful earthquake strikes central italy another powerful earthquake strikes central italy please scroll down for video initial reports on the magnitude of the tremors varied – while usgs and italian media first talked of a 7.1 earthquake, the european-mediterranean seismological center (emsc) said the tremor was magnitude 6.5 or 6.6. italy civil protection reports buildings collapsing in a number of locations following sunday's tremors. they did not provide any information regarding casualties. local rai tv reports that the tremor was powerful enough to wake the residents of the capital rome, who reported walls of buildings shaking. while according to rai radio, at least two buildings collapsed in norcia - the basilica di san benedetto and the cathedral of santa maria argentea. before after local media also reported destruction at the church of saint augustine in amatrice, which lost its bell tower . according to the mayor of ussita, a commune in the marche district with around 450 inhabitants, 90 percent of the buildings in the area were brought down by the quake. emergency services across the region are currently checking the destroyed buildings for casualties, civil protection authorities said. aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.5 still reportedly rock the area. the usgs says the quake was centered 6 km (3.7 miles) north of norcia, a town in the province of perugia. the epicenter lay some 10 kilometers deep. norcia is home to some 5,000 people. italians who live in the areas affected by the quake rushed to the web, posting videos of shaking furniture inside their homes. italy's national commission for the forecast and prevention of major risks (cgr) cautioned friday that more powerful earthquakes could hit the region in the nearest future, identifying at least three areas at risk for further seismic activity. \"there is no current evidence that the (seismic) sequence underway is coming to an end,\" the commission warned. this week's quakes come mere two months after almost 300 people were killed in the region by a quake that levelled several small towns ( via

26, 2016 israeli religious nationalists see the palestinian territory as part of the country, citing jews’ connection to the land from biblical times. the us has intensified criticism of israeli settlement building in the west bank in recent months, warning that it is eating away at hopes for a two-state solution. settlements in the west bank are viewed as illegal under international law and are major stumbling blocks to peace efforts because they are built on land seized in the 1967 war which palestinians see as part of their future state. at an american israel public affairs committee conference in march, trump described an “unbreakable bond” between the us and israel. “when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,” trump told delegates, in a speech that heaped praise on israel and derided palestinians as perpetrators of violence. recalling rounds of failed peace talks between the two parties, trump blamed palestinian leaders. “to make a great deal, you need two willing participants,” trump said. “we know israel is willing to deal. israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years.” friedman reiterated that trump would recognise jerusalem as israel’s capital and move the us embassy there – which would break with decades of precedent and put washington at odds with most un member states. there were chants of “lock her up” when trump’s democrat rival hillary clinton’s name was mentioned at the rally ahead of the 8 november vote – a common refrain among trump supporters who want to see her jailed over an emails scandal. “i hate hillary. she’s the same like (barack) obama,” said ran hofman, 54, who waved an israeli flag. “they screw up the whole world.” a brief video message from trump of about one minute was played at the event. “together we will stand up to the enemies like iran, bent on destroying israel and her people,” trump said. “together we will make america and israel safe again.” will ferrell just came back as bush to destroy trump (video) natalie dickinsoncomments famed actor and funnyman will ferrell returned to comedy central to reprise his caricature of despised president george w. bush to hilarious effect. “first of all, i’d like to say something about my cousin billy bush. he’s been in the news a lot lately. him and that disgraced pumpkin, donald trump, talking on the bus. i just want to say one thing, we bushes don’t act like that, okay? we have standards, and we’re raised certain way. we would never, under any circumstances, ride a bus. when you’re a bush, you ride in a limousine or a jump jet, or maybe a monster truck called sasquatch express. never a bus.” ferrell then goes on point out that somehow, the utterly abhorrent character of republican has whitewashed bush’s less viscerally appalling but equally reprehensible legacy. “this dunderhead is making me look great. i destabilized an entire region [iraq], but no one seems to care anymore thanks to the bozo trump here. folks forgotten how i tanked the economy or how i didn’t get bin laden.” nobody should forget how the great recession was engineered and executed under the watch of george w. bush or how the wars he began mortgaged our nation’s future and led to the deaths of millions around the world. one shudders to think of what a president trump would do to this country and the safety of the free world. watch it here: easy to know what is up - link anonymous coward (uid 73268493)report copyright violation easy to know what is

lendmanin: government , government corruption , obama exposed , war propaganda , world news october 20 marked the fifth anniversary of muammar gaddafi’s sodomized-related death – us imperial viciousness responsible for his murder and destruction africa’s most developed, socially responsible nation. endless violence and chaos replaced a society safe and fit to live in. gaddafi provided libyans with important benefits americans can’t imagine. more on this below. hillary orchestrated war to eliminate him, wanting us-controlled puppet governance replacing libyan sovereign independence. in early 2011, made-in-the-usa protests preceded us-led nato terror-bombing, indiscriminately massacring civilians, creating charnel house conditions. endless violence continues daily, exacerbated by isis fighters infesting parts of the country, washington supporting them with funding, weapons and other material aid. obama and hillary wanted gaddafi eliminated for instituting policies all nations should embrace. previous articles discussed them. he supported pan-africanism, a united states of africa free from imperial domination. he wanted libyans sharing in the country’s oil wealth, a notion foreign to america and other western powers. under his 1999 decision no. 111, all libyans got free healthcare, education, electricity, water, training, rehabilitation, housing assistance, disability and old-age benefits, interest-free state loans, as well as generous subsidies to study abroad, buy a new car, help couples when they marry, practically free gasoline, and more. literacy under gaddafi rose from 20 – 80%. libya’s hospitals and private clinics were some of the region’s best. now they’re in shambles. vital public services he provided no longer exist. pre-war, libyans had african’s highest standard of living. homelessness was nonexistent. gaddafi believed all libyans had a right to a home or rent-free apartment, notions unheard of in the west. he rejected farcical western-style money-controlled democracy (sic), deplored crony capitalism and neoliberal harshness. during his tenure, women had the right to vote, participate politically, as well as own and sell property independently of their husbands. clause 5 of libya’s 1969 constitution granted them equal status with men, notably for education and employment. in january 2011, weeks before us-led nato naked aggression began, the un human rights council praised gaddafi for instituting and supporting important political, economic, education, social and cultural rights. he called his great man-made river (gmmr) development of an ocean-sized aquifer beneath libya’s sands the “eighth wonder of the world” – wanting all libyans sharing in its benefits. washington and rogue western partners wanted it privatized for exclusive corporate gain. under gaddafi, the central bank of libya was state-owned, the interest-free libyan dinar used for productive economic growth, not speculation, profits and bonuses for predatory bankers. he funded africa’s only communications satellite, saving hundreds of millions of dollars for low-cost incoming and outgoing calls. he provided two-thirds of the $42 billion needed to launch a public african central bank, monetary fund and investment bank. he supported a new gold standard, replacing dollars with gold dinars, aiming to provide real monetary wealth and value, free from predatory western lending agencies. washington wants dollar hegemony, maintaining it as the world’s reserve currency, an agenda challenged by russia, china and other nations, increasingly trading bilaterally in their own currencies. russia’s vladimir putin is threatened. neocons infesting washington want regime change. his redoubtable leadership prevents it. will nuclear war on russia follow hillary’s ascension to power next year? will the unthinkable become reality? submit your review how nato is trying to sabotage the turkey-russia reset - m.k. bhadrakumar citizen journalism with a punch how nato is trying to sabotage the turkey-russia reset deployments to the black sea and rhetoric on aleppo are serving one important goal -- placing pressure on turkey to backpedal on rapprochement with moscow originally appeared at indian punchline the secretary-general of the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) jens stoltenberg in his ‘doorstep statement’ today on the 2-day meeting of the alliance’s defence ministers in brussels said, inter alia, that an agenda item concerns “making progress on plans” for more nato presence in the black sea region. he cited russia’s belligerence as the rationale for such move. interestingly, there was much emphasis on the russian operations in syria in stoltenberg’s media briefing. ( transcript ) prima facie, syria is not ‘nato territory’, but a linkage is being established between nato posturing toward russia and the latter’s military presence in syria. this can only happen at the behest of the united states, because stoltenberg wouldn’t even sneeze sans green signal from washington. of course, generally speaking, boosting the ‘enemy’ image of russia is useful and necessary for washington to keep the alliance going, since the member countries are otherwise loathe to increase their defence budgets to 2% of gdp. the us also calibrates the nato posturing toward russia to curb any proximity developing between individual european countries and moscow at the bilateral level as well as to ensure that the sanctions against russia will remain in place. however, the plan to discuss black sea deployment as well as stoltenberg’s emphasis on aleppo also appears to serve another us objective – namely, put pressure on turkey to delimit its strategic autonomy vis-à-vis syrian conflict. significantly, nato intervened publicly – alongside an american demarche – to force spain to refuse refuelling for the russian flotilla of warships (including aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov) heading for eastern mediterranean. this has been justified on the ground that with beefed up military prowess, russian operations in aleppo might intensify. ( rt ) the alibi that nato has advanced is laughable – namely, humanitarian considerations – given the alliance’s brutal war crimes in libya and its role in the gruesome murder of muammar gaddafi. seumas milne wrote in guardian newspaper at that time, ‘if there were global justice, nato would be in the dock over libya.’ ( guardian ) so, why is stoltenberg acting like this? the answer is, spain’s rethink on refuelling the russian flotilla on the basis of a nato demarche, is intended to create a precedent that will also be applicable to turkey. indeed, washington is having a difficult time to ‘manage’ turkey. turkish president recep erdogan is on guard vis-à-vis washington ever since ankara concluded that the us had a hand in the july 15 attempted coup to overthrow his government. turkey’s deputy prime minister numan kurtulmus had some strong words for the obama administration when he left ankara for washington on tuesday on a mission to put more pressure on washington to extradite the islamist preacher fetullah gulen. (hurriyet) but then, wouldn’t ankara know that washington simply cannot extradite gulen who has worked for the cia? of course the turks would know that alright. so, it is a catch-22 situation. gulen has become a lump stuck in uncle sam’s throat. read a caustic commentary by the pro-government sabah newspaper titled what happens if washington refuses to extradite fetullah gulen? to be sure, turkey’s role in any plans on nato deployment in the black sea will be crucial because of its prerogatives under the montreaux convention (1936), which severely restricts the traffic of warships (other than turkey and russia’s) through the bosporus. in principle, turkey will be obliged to go along with any nato plans to step up deployment in the black sea. but in reality, turkey would know that moscow expects it to fully and faithfully observe the provisions of the montreaux convention. you bet erdogan will twiddle thumbs and keep stoltenberg waiting in the ante-room, no matter the decision to accelerate nato deployment in the black sea. clearly, the us hopes to somehow insert nato into the turkey-russia rapprochement. washington feels uneasy that erdogan and russian president vladimir putin are effectively coordinating their approaches to the aleppo situation. what emerges out of all this is the desperate extent to which washington will go to stall the progress of the russian-syrian mlitary operations to liberate aleppo from the al-qaeda affiliate nusra. conceivably, the obama administration would prefer to somehow keep the syrian situation fluid for hillary clinton to do what she promises to do — namely, revive the ‘regime change agenda in that country, if need be through a us military intervention. (see the piece in telegraph titled hillary clinton will reset syria policy against ‘murderous’ assad regime .) erdogan disclosed today that the turkish military operations in northern syria will steer clear of aleppo. he said he has discussed the matter with putin. at the same time, he gave a punch to washington by revealing that turkey next intends to target manbij in northern syria with a view to drive out from the city the syrian kurdish militia, who happen to be the us’ closest ally on the syrian chessboard.

daniel greenfieldis hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails? these past few days have seen a major shift in the clinton tactics. during the original investigation, the clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at republicans for \"wasting time\" investigating hillary, but did not attack the fbi. it misrepresented fbi statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way we're seeing now. but now we have open hostilities between lynch at the doj and the fbi. we have the clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the fbi. we have countless media hit pieces aimed at the fbi. the obvious question is why. the clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. it certainly didn't begin an ill-advised campaign against the fbi. that's the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. that is to say everyone who isn't in the media. so what's going on here? 1. the clintons thought they were done. it's close to the election. so they're lashing out. it's typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the clintons. hillary tried playing humble. she tried apologizing. but a moment ago, her victory seemed inevitable, and now she's in a state of fury at having it put at risk. 2. there is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the clinton campaign. which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the fbi with both barrels. it's desperate to smear the fbi as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges. the attacks are a warning to treat hillary with kid gloves again... or else. the first is plausible. to a degree. but for all of hillary's awkwardness, she didn't lose it in the past. why is she losing it now? there's no evidence beyond speculation for the latter. and yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking. if the clinton campaign were panicking, this is what it would look like. fighting ghost fascists while aiding real ones glen ford2016 presidential campaign by bar executive editor glen ford an architect of regime-change, coups, no-fly zones, rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become commander-in-chief, yet the bulk of what passes for the left is “engaged in a 1930s-style ‘united front’ against a ‘fascism’ that was never a threat in 21 st century america.” donald trump, the orange menace, didn’t have a chance of becoming president. hillary clinton, on the other hand, is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on earth. fighting ghost fascists while aiding real ones by bar executive editor glen ford “trump’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with russia and china drove most of the republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into hillary clinton’s imperial big tent.” hillary clinton’s impending -- and totally predictable -- landslide victory on november 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a “fascist” white nationalist takeover of the u.s. executive branch of government in 2016. that was always a red (or “orange”) herring, a phony “barbarians at the gate” threat that -- as wikileaks documents confirmed -- john podesta and hillary’s other handlers fervently hoped would convey “lesser evil” status to their manifestly unpopular candidate. there was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the hillary camp’s favoring donald trump or, alternatively, ted cruz. it is standard democratic party practice to position themselves just to the left of the republicans. in a duopoly electoral system, victory lies in where the cake is cut. by hugging close to the gop’s flanks, national democratic candidates can lay claim to a “center-left” spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of u.s. public opinion on most issues. by this calculus, democrats are supposed to win, unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race (failure to “stand up” to the blacks) and foreign policy (failure to “stand up” to whoever is the designated foreign enemy). race is the trickiest part of the equation, since white supremacy is embedded in the american political conversation, hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy. “his overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites.” trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti-corporate message that laid the blame on wall street for (white) american job losses and falling living standards. he also calculated -- correctly, it turns out -- that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown, many white americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at russians; that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad. both of trump’s central policies backfired, dooming his campaign. his overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites, who have given majorities to national republicans since 1968 but whose self-image is that they are not, as individuals, racist. (certainly, white women found further reason to reject his candidacy.) much more spectacularly, trump’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with russia and china drove most of the republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into hillary clinton’s imperial big tent. at the national level, the duopoly system, as we had known it, virtually ceased to exist – a fact dramatically driven home by the near-universal corporate media rejection of donald trump, the candidacy they had done so much to create. the near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election, a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle, including on the moribund electoral level. with the ruling class gathered in one big tent, and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the gop, the system itself was in disarray. what was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class, with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate, had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed-out husk, at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire, yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign. “the near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election.” in these pages, we had been saying since last year that donald trump could not win; that bernie sanders’ fate would be sealed in the southern primaries; and that, although ruling class money would insure clinton an election by landslide, it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the democratic “base,” who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her big tent. as we wrote on may 18 of this year: “outsized fear of trump is hysteria. these days, the ‘brown shirts’ wear blue. hillary is the candidate of wall street, war and austerity – not trump, the racist america firster. and, he can’t win, anyway – not with tens of millions of ‘moderate’ republicans and most of the party’s funders rushing into hillary’s welcoming embrace.” but sadly, hysteria does reign in most of the “left” precincts of america. those who did not hesitate to kick hillary when she appeared to be “down” -- in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to sanders -- are terrified to kick her when she is “up” and primed to take the helm of the hyper-power. they are engaged in a 1930s-style “united front” against a “fascism” that was never a threat in 21 st century america, where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich (but also a fascism) has made brown-shirts (and klansmen) utterly superfluous. these trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism, which is now firmly entrenched in power with hillary as its champion, in favor of a crusade against an “orange” menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power. they have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless -- except, of course, to the fascists-in-charge. bar executive editor glen ford can be contacted at [email protected] . путин рассказал, когда в крыму решат проблему с пресной водой 0 комментариев 7 поделились отвечая на соответствующий вопрос участника форума виктора тарасова, глава российского государства отметил: \"мы направили на решение этой задачи из федерального бюджета 23 с лишним миллиарда рублей. с 2015 по 2020 г. планируется в федеральной целевой программе по развитию крыма и севастополя еще свыше 40 млрд руб.\", — сказал путин. он также добавил, что эти деньги необходимо израсходовать рационально. \"федеральные и региональные органы власти эту проблему должны решить и обязательно решат, у меня в этом сомнений нет никаких\". президент также напомнил, что на первых порах проблема с пресной водой на полуострове стояла \"очень остро, особенно после того как наши соседи отключили крым от северо-крымского\". в данный момент сделано очень многое, но сама проблема осталась, подчеркнул глава государства. отметим, что кроме прочего, владимир путин призвал активистов онф продолжать мониторинг расходования бюджетных средств. один из участников пленарного заседания форума онф \"форум действий. крым\" отметил, что федеральной целевой программой по развитию массового спорта для крыма предусмотрено 4,5 млрд руб. на реконструкцию восьми крупных спортивных объектов. если отложить реконструкцию одного из них, то на освободившиеся деньги можно построить 2,5 тыс. спортивных площадок для развития массового спорта. он попросил президента \"пересмотреть назначения\" в пользу таких спортивных площадок. в первый день упомянутого форума, 25 октября его работа развернулась на трех тематических площадках: \"образование и культура как основы национальной идентичности\", \"качество повседневной жизни\" и \"честная и эффективная экономика\". участники мероприятия сосредоточились на наиболее актуальных проблемах, выявленных активистами региональных отделений в крыму и севастополе по результатам обработки обращений граждан, опросов, экспертных совещаний читайте

the largest gmo free zone in america christina sarichsonoma county california just voted to create the largest gmo free zone in america nov 14, 2016 0 0 just when it seemed the biotech industry couldn’t get any more gargantuan, with the threat of a bayer-monsanto merger , not only were the ttip and tpp pronounced dead , but sonoma county california just passed a successful ban on the cultivation on genetically modified crops, creating the largest gmo-free zone in america . measure m passed with 55.9% of the vote in favor of banning crop cultivation. the vote transpired on the same day as the u.s. presidential election. the ban will affect a whopping 13,734 square miles bridging sonoma, humboldt, marin, mendocino, santa cruz and trinity counties. monsanto, syngenta, bayer, basf, and dupont all descended on sonoma county to fight measure m, but local farmers largely wanted an opportunity to grow organic, non-gmo crops without the fear of contamination through cross-pollination. (you can see who supported a ‘yes’ note and who supported a ‘no’ vote, here .) “my right to grow non-gmo should not be threatened by someone else’s business practices that are harmful to mine. millions of dollars in lost export revenue has occurred from gmo contamination,” says joey smith , owner/manager of let’s go farm in santa rosa. “because people growing genetically engineered crops are not required to register, we don’t know exactly how many genetically engineered crops are growing here in sonoma county.” he explains. “we don’t want gmo crops proliferating here, so that’s why we are taking action. the measure is carefully written to be fair to all farmers. measure m is really about being proactive, just like the gmo growing bans in the five other ca counties.” already, 80% of sonoma county’s dairy farms are certified organic, and the wine-making industry has been trying to go organic as well. measure m will make it much easier for farmers growing a multitude of crops to do so without using herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and petroleum-based fertilizers, but also without their hard-earned yield going to waste due to gm contamination. the measure will protect farmland, pastureland, and surrounding green spaces, and hopefully the almost 14 thousand square miles which are now to be gm-free, will eventually expand to cover an even larger area. when this area is tied to others in the u.s. which have smaller gmo-free zones, we can start to see a patchwork of resistance that has paid off. connecticut and maine have passed gmo labeling laws as of may of 2013 , but are still waiting on triggering states for those laws to go into effect. maui, hawaii has successfully passed a gmo moratorium which took effect in march of 2015. both josephine and jackson counties in oregon have banned gmos, though they are said to be in conflict with a state law. vermont fought hard against the gm industry and passed a law that requires all gmo food to be labeled as of july 1, 2016. san juan county in washington has also banned gm crops. the gmo-free movement has grown slowly, but surely over the years, and sonoma’s recent addition of gm-free lands is a shining example of what grassroots movements can do to fight against the trillion-dollar biotech machine. it isn’t impossible, but it has been hard as heck. consider purchasing some sonoma county organic wine or fresh produce over the holidays to toast their successful endeavors. realities faced by black canadians are a national shame anonymoustweet widget by robyn maynard canada, including its french-speaking regions, is home to much the same kind of systemic racism as its southern neighbor, according to a united nations working group report. black women’s poverty rates are “almost five times higher than that of white canadian women.” in montreal, “a 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more.” realities faced by black canadians are a national shame by robyn maynard this article previously appeared in the montreal gazette . “ black montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions.” after holding consultations in quebec, nova scotia and ontario last month, the united nations working group on people of african descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. the group’s preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in canada’s black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. underlying these injustices, the un working group has made clear, is systemic racism. the un is right to be concerned, and montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. the enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in new france, and indeed was legal until 1834. the fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian charmaine nelson reminds us that many present-day montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like james mcgill and john redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. enslavement may be over, but centuries later black montrealers — the largest visible minority in the city — continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. a 2010 study by sociologists léonel bernard and christopher mcall found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called “black crime,” that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in montreal. “the enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in new france, and indeed was legal until 1834.” a report commissioned by the montreal police, leaked to la presse, found that in st-michel and montréal-nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing “gang activities,” when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. high profile cases of police abuse of black montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of veckqueth stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at nelson mandela park. black women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of majiza philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. a 2008 study found that black girls in montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. beyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. the un working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. black lives matter-toronto and other black activist groups in toronto, kingston, ottawa, vancouver and montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of abdirahman abdi in ottawa, and bony jean-pierre in montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. if canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the un — alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country — need to be both addressed and redressed. robyn maynard is an activist and writer living in montreal, author of the forthcoming book policing black bodies (2017). videos on the pacific crest trail association and the lavoy finicim murder graywolfposted on october 30, 2016 by graywolf

unleashed(by deepak ramola , uplift connect ) rooted in the hearts of many hindus is the belief that if you breathe your last in kashi (varanasi) you attain what is popularly known as ‘kashi labh’ or ‘the fruit of kashi’—moksh or “release from the cycle of rebirth impelled by the law of karma”. kashi labh mukti bhawan in varanasi is one of the three guesthouses in the city where people check in to die. the other two are mumukshu bhawan and ganga labh bhawan. established in 1908, mukti bhawan is well-known within the city and outside. bhairav nath shukla has been the manager of mukti bhawan for 44 years. he has seen the rich and the poor take refuge in the guesthouse in their final days as they await death and hope to find peace. shukla hopes with and for them. he sits on the wooden bench in the courtyard, against the red brick wall and shares with me 12 recurring life lessons from the 12000 deaths he has witnessed in his experience as the manager of mukti bhawan: people check in to die. 1. resolve all conflicts before you go shukla recounts the story of shri ram sagar mishr, a sanskrit scholar of his times. mishr was the eldest of six brothers and was closest to the youngest one. years ago an ugly argument between the two brothers led to a wall to partition the house. in his final days, mishr walked to the guesthouse carrying his little paan case and asked to keep room no. 3 reserved for him. he was sure he will pass away on the 16th day from his arrival. on the 14th day he said, “ ask my estranged brother of 40 years to come see me. this bitterness makes my heart heavy. i am anxious to resolve every conflict.” a letter was sent out. on the 16th day when the youngest brother arrived, mishr held his hand and asked to bring down the wall dividing the house. he asked his brother for forgiveness. both brothers wept and mid sentence, mishr stopped speaking. his face became calm. he was gone in a moment. shukla has seen this story replay in many forms over the years. “people carry so much baggage, unnecessarily, all through their life only wanting to drop it at the very end of their journey. the trick lies not in not having conflicts but in resolving them as soon as one can,” says shukla. the trick lies not in not having conflicts but in resolving them as soon as one can. 2. simplicity is the truth of life “people stop eating indulgent food when they know they are going to go. the understanding that dawns on many people in their final days is that they should’ve lived a simple life. they regret that the most,” says shukla. a simple life, as he explains, can be attained by spending less. we spend more to accumulate more and thus create more need. to find contentment in less is the secret to having more. 3. filter out people’s bad traits shukla maintains that every person has shades of good and bad. but instead of dismissing “bad” people outrightly, we must seek out their good qualities. harbouring bitterness for certain people comes from concentrating on their negatives. if you focus on the good qualities though, you spend that time getting to know them better or, maybe even, loving them. to find contentment in less is the secret to having more. 4. be willing to seek help from others to know and do everything by yourself might feel empowering but it limits one from absorbing what others have learnt. shukla believes we must help others, but more importantly, have the courage to seek help when we’re in need. every person in the world knows more than us in some respect. and their knowledge can help us, only if we’re open to it. he recounts the incident of an old woman being admitted on a rainy day back in the 80s. the people who got her there left her without filling the inquiry form. a few hours later, the police came to trace the relatives of the old lady who, they said, were runaway naxalites. shukla pretended to know nothing. the police left. when the lady’s relatives returned next morning, shukla asked the leader uninhibitedly, “when you can kill 5-8 people yourself why didn’t you simply shoot your nani and cremate her yourself? why did you make me lie and feel ashamed?” the grandson fell to his knees and pleaded for forgiveness saying no one amongst them is capable of helping his religious grandmother attain salvation. he respects that, and is the reason why he brought her to mukti bhawan. we must help others, but more importantly, have the courage to seek help when we’re in need. 5. find beauty in simple things mukti bhavan plays soulful bhajans and devotional songs three times a day. “some people”, he says, “stop and admire a note or the sound of the instruments as if they have never heard it before, even if they have. they pause to appreciate it and find beauty in it.” but that’s not true of everyone, he adds. people who are too critical or too proud, are the ones who find it hard to find joy in small things because their minds are preoccupied with “seemingly” more important things. 6. acceptance is liberation most people shirk away from accepting what they are going through. this constant denial breeds in them emotions that are highly dangerous. only once you accept your situation is when you become free to decide what to do about it. without acceptance you are always in the grey space. when you are not in denial of a problem you have the strength to find a solution. indifference, avoidance, and denial of a certain truth, shukla believes, cause anxiety; they develop a fear of that thing in the person. instead, accept the situation so you are free to think what you want to do about it and how. acceptance will liberate you and empower you. stop and admire a note or the sound of the instruments. 7. accepting everyone as the same makes service easier the secret to shukla’s unfazed dedication and determination towards his demanding job can be understood via this life lesson. he admits that life would’ve been difficult if he treated people who admit themselves to mukti bhavan differently, based on their caste, creed, colour, and social or economic status. categorisation leads to complication and one ends up serving no one well. “the day you treat everyone the same is the day you breathe light and worry less about who might feel offended or not. make your job easier,” he says. 8. if/when you find your purpose, do something about it to have awareness about one’s calling is great, but only if you do something about it. a lot of people, shukla says, know their purpose but don’t do anything about realising it, making it come to life. simply sitting on it is worse than not having a calling in the first place. having a perspective towards your purpose will help you measure the time and effort you need to dedicate to it, while you’re caught up in what you think you can’t let go or escape. take action on what truly matters. categorisation leads to complication and one ends up serving no one well. 9. habits become values shukla recommends cultivating good habits to be able to house good values. and building good habits happens over time, with practice. “it’s like building a muscle; you have to keep at it everyday.” till one doesn’t consistently work towards being just or kind or truthful or honest or compassionate, every single time he is challenged, one cannot expect to have attained that quality. 10. choose what you want to learn in the vastness of the infinite amount of knowledge available to us it is easy to get lost and confused. “the key lesson here is to be mindful of choosing what you deeply feel will be of value to you,” he says. people might impose subjects and philosophies on you because it interests them and while you must acknowledge their suggestions, the wise thing to do is delve deeper into what rejoices your own heart and mind. with a smile on his face shukla says, “in the last days of their life a lot of people can’t speak, walk or communicate with others with as much ease as they could, earlier. so, they turn inwards. and start to remember the things that made their heart sing once, things that they cared to learn more about over the course of their life, which enriches their days now.” they start to remember the things that made their heart sing once. 11. you don’t break ties with people; you break ties with the thought they produce you can seldom distance yourself from people you have truly loved or connected with in some way. however, in any relationship, along the way, certain mismatch of ideologies causes people to stop communicating. this never means you are no longer associated with that person. it simply means that you don’t associate with a dominant thought that person brings with him/her, and to avoid more conflict you move away. the divorce, shukla affirms, is with the thought and never with the person. to understand that is to unburden yourself from being bitter and revengeful. 12. 10 percent of what you earn should be kept aside for dharma dharma, shukla doesn’t define as something religious or spiritual. instead, he says it is associated more with doing good for others and feeling responsible about that. a simple calculation according to him is to keep 10 percent of your income for goodwill. many people donate or do charitable acts towards the end of their life because death is hard on them. in their suffering, they begin to empathise with others’ suffering. he says those who have the companionship of loved ones, the blessings of unknown strangers, and an all-encompassing goodwill of people exit peacefully and gracefully. that is possible when you don’t cling on to everything you have, and leave some part of it for others. feature image: jorge royan why this orthodox rabbi supports trump howard portnoyprint i am an orthodox rabbi. i am also

ansarynuclear tensions between us, russia reach ‘dangerous’ point 10/31/2016 press tv us-russian relations have slipped to their lowest point since the end of the cold war, with tensions now spilling over to nuclear pacts and each side accusing the other of cheating, experts say. “i would have to say that, without question, this is the low point in us-russian relations since the end of the cold war,” steven pifer, an arms control expert at the brookings institution, told npr. the relationship took a turn for the worse two years ago with the conflict in ukraine and slid lower last year with russia’s air campaign in syria, noted pifer, a former us ambassador to ukraine. this year, tensions have continued to mount with russian and us aircraft buzzing each other over the baltic and washington accusing moscow of trying to interfere in the us presidential elections, he added. bickering over nuclear issues has also increased markedly in recent months. early this month, russia moved a battery of nuclear-capable missile launchers within range of three baltic states, in what us officials said was a gesture to express displeasure with nato. a russian serviceman walks past russian iskander-m missile launchers before a rehearsal for the victory day parade, with the moscow international business center also known as ”moskva-city” seen in the background, at a range in moscow, russia, may 5, 2016. (photo by reuters) in late october, russia unveiled images of a new intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed the satan 2, which, it says, can carry up to 15 separate warheads powerful enough to destroy an area the size of texas. the us, in september, flew three long-range nuclear bombers over eastern europe to participate in nato military exercises. these developments have worried nuclear arms experts. “we are in a dangerous situation,” hans kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the federation of american scientists, told npr. “certainly a situation that is much more dire or tense than it was 10 years ago.” in 1987, four years before the soviet union collapsed, washington and moscow signed a long-negotiated treaty – known as the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty – to eliminate their arsenals of nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. “since may 2013, the obama administration has repeatedly raised concerns with russia regarding its lack of compliance with the inf treaty,” a senior administration official told npr on condition of anonymity. the official said washington has called for a rare meeting of the treaty’s special verification commission “in the coming weeks” to try to resolve the matter. “i actually think this is a good step,” pifer said of the decision. the us claims that an intermediate-range missile being developed by russia is not in line with the inf treaty and wants clarification from moscow. “what the administration has said is that they provided enough information to the russians so that the russians could identify the missile in question. the russians thus far have said no, they haven’t got enough information, so you’re in that kind of war of words,” pifer added. president putin speaks during a news conference. (file photo by afp) the war of words further escalated in early october when russian president vladimir putin announced the suspension of a cold war deal with the us to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium. “that, i believe, was a little bit of a poke at president obama, who attaches a lot of importance to the nuclear nonproliferation agenda,” pifer said. tensions are bound to mount even further over the next few months as the us and its nato allies prepare to move thousands of troops as well as heavy military equipment to countries along and near russia’s border, namely estonia, latvia and lithuania. a us army convoy rolls through liepupe, latvia, on its way from estonia to germany. (photo by european pressphoto agency) “this is a gradual sort of escalation of tensions between the two sides that goes beyond discourse and just disagreements over a treaty,” kristensen said. “it’s getting pretty deep now.” the rising tensions between the two nuclear powers have other experts worried. “we could head into a nuclear conflict which would devastate humanity,” american writer and retired professor james petras told press tv earlier this month. “we need to move away from this saber-rattling from washington into a position that could come to terms with peaceful co-existence, but i don’t see that on the horizon in present or the near future with either hillary clinton or donald trump as presidential candidates,” he said. geo-engineering unlikely to work, conservation group says geo-engineering unlikely to work, conservation group says posted on nov 3, 2016 by alex kirby / climate news network biofilm used in research into carbon capture: doubts persist about geo-engineering. (energy.gov via wikimedia commons) london—the global watchdog responsible for protecting the world ’ s wealth of species, the un ’ s convention on biological diversity (cbd), has looked at the hopes for reining in climate change through geo-engineering. its bleak conclusion, echoing that reached by many independent scientists, is that the chances are “highly uncertain”. “novel means”, in this context, describes trying to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by removing them from the atmosphere, and altering the amount of heat from the sun that reaches the earth. some scientists and policymakers say geo-engineering, as these strategies are collectively known, is essential if the world is to meet the goals of the paris agreement . this is because current attempts to reduce emissions cannot make big enough cuts fast enough to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2°c above their pre-industrial levels, the agreement’s basic goal. but the cbd says in a report that geo-engineering, while it could possibly help to prevent the world overheating, might endanger global biodiversity and have other unpredictable effects. many independent analysts have raised similar concerns.attempts to increase the amount of carbon in the oceans, in order to remove ghgs, have so far shown disappointing results. one report doubted that geo-engineering could slow sea-level rise . another said it could not arrest the melting of arctic ice . a third study found that geo-engineering would make things little better and might even make global warming worse . transboundary impacts the lead author of the cbd geo-engineering report is a british scientist, dr phillip williamson, of the uk’s natural environment research council . he is an associate fellow in the school of environmental sciences at the university of east anglia , uk. the cbd originally became involved in climate geo-engineering in 2008, because member governments were concerned that experiments to fertilise the oceans could pose unknown risks to the environment (they were then unregulated when carried out in international waters). the cbd’s concern expanded to include other geo-engineering techniques, especially atmospheric methods which could have uncertain transboundary impacts. some scientists argue that “geo-engineering” is a hazily-defined term and prefer to speak instead simply of “greenhouse gas removal”. dr williamson and his colleagues say assessment of the impacts of geo-engineering on biodiversity “is not straightforward and is subject to many uncertainties”. on greenhouse gas removal they warn that removing a given quantity of a greenhouse gas would not fully compensate for an earlier ‘overshoot’ of emissions. new risks in some cases, they say, the cure may be worse than the disease: “the large-scale deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (beccs) seems likely to have significant negative impacts on biodiversity through land use change.” when it comes to attempts to reflect sunlight back out into space or to manage solar radiation, a familiar theme recurs: “there are high levels of uncertainty about the impacts of srm [solar radiation management] techniques, which could present significant new risks to biodiversity.” time and again, it seems, a potential advance is liable to be cancelled by an equally likely reverse: if srm benefits coral reefs by decreasing temperature-induced bleaching (as it may), in certain conditions “it may also increase, indirectly, the impacts of ocean acidification.” there could even be a risk in some circumstances of loss to the earth’s protective ozone layer. dr williamson and his colleagues believe that geo-engineering is essential—if it can be made to work—because of the diminishing chances that anything else will. “i’m sceptical. that’s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible” they write: “it may still be possible that deep and very rapid decarbonisation by all countries might allow climate change to be kept within a 2°c limit by emission reduction alone. however, any such window of opportunity is rapidly closing.” repeatedly, those two words recur: a suggested technique or development will be “highly uncertain”. most of the report amounts to a very cautious call for more research, coupled with an implicit acceptance that in the end geo-engineering is unlikely to prove capable of contributing much to climate mitigation. dr williamson told the climate news network: “i’m sceptical. that’s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible (for all sorts of reasons)” at the scale needed. when the cbd member governments meet in december they are expected to call for more research: a safe option in most circumstances, but far from a ringing endorsement of a technology once seen as very promising.

burundi in exodus from international criminal court afp, october 26, 2016 gambia has announced its withdrawal from the international criminal court (icc), accusing the hague-based tribunal of the “persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially africans”. the announcement late tuesday comes after similar decisions this month by south africa and burundi to abandon the troubled institution, set up to try the world’s worst crimes. information minister sheriff bojang said in an announcement on state television that the court had been used “for the persecution of africans and especially their leaders” while ignoring crimes committed by the west. he singled out the case of former british prime minister tony blair, who the icc decided not to indict over the iraq war. {snip} the withdrawal, he said, “is warranted by the fact that the icc, despite being called international criminal court, is in fact an international caucasian court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially africans”. the icc, set up in 2002, is often accused of bias against africa and has also struggled with a lack of cooperation, including from the united states, which has signed the court’s treaty but never ratified it. gambia has been trying without success to use the court to punish the european union for deaths of thousands of african migrants trying to reach its shores. {snip} south africa’s decision followed a dispute last year when sudanese president omar al-bashir visited the country despite being the subject of an icc arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. earlier this month, burundi said it would leave the court, while namibia and kenya have also raised the possibility. {snip} russian companies to be unable to use linkedin services — company -

(photo by afp) more than 5,200 refugees have died across the world since the beginning of 2016, says the international organization for migration (iom). the organization, which is based in geneva, said on friday that of a total of 5,238 deaths, 3,930 people died trying to cross the mediterranean sea by boat, indicating a 170-person increase compared to 2015. on wednesday, the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) made a different account with more than 3,800 deaths in the mediterranean since january, also noting that it was a new record compared to 2015. over 280 asylum seekers trying to reach the european union died off the libyan shores recently, according to the iom. the eu said on thursday it had begun training the libyan coast guard how to curb the influx of asylum seekers. “today we are starting the training of the libyan coast guard in operation sophia which is a very important step,” said the eu foreign affairs chief, federica mogherini, as she arrived for a meeting with nato defense ministers in brussels. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said the western military alliance had just launched its own operation sea guardian in the mediterranean to help support operation sophia. the eu launched operation sophia last year after hundreds of asylum seekers died when their rickety boats sank off southern italy. the central mediterranean route has seen more asylum seekers risk their lives in recent months after the eu reached an accord with turkey in march to halt an influx of refugees crossing the aegean to reach europe. stoltenberg further said within two weeks ships and aircraft would be provided by nato allies to help back up operation sophia. loading ... assange ‘finally afforded opportunity’ to give statement over rape accusation truth broadcast network4 hours ago 2 views 0 comments 0 likes 'i today.'

arkhangelskaya, special to rbtheducation , children , rbth daily bella devyatkina source: rossia one tv channel earlier this month bella instantly became famous thanks to \"amazing people,\" a show on the russian television. the video with the girl answering questions, singing songs and talking about herself in different languages went viral. \"compared with this child, i feel like an idiot,\" users wrote in the comments section. video by youtube yulia devyatkina, bella's mother, said her daughter is not a child prodigy; they just invested a lot of time and effort in her development. \"not every child needs to speak six languages, but any kid can master two or three,\" the mother said. bella's parents understand that their daughter will not be using all these languages in every day life. \"when school starts we will focus on english, french and chinese,\" the mother said. \"we also don't worry that bella will not be interested in her classes. she has the same knowledge that any four-year-old child should have, but she is able to discuss these topics in different languages.\" french baby talk bella's mom is a linguist and has been teaching english to children for seven years. her father works at the radio research and development institute based in moscow. the family has an average income, but the parents decided that their daughter's development is their main priority. italian polyglot: ‘to understand russians you must speak russian’ initially, the parents wanted bella to speak english like a native speaker, and the mother spoke with bella in english and russian from birth, alternating every other day. she made sure that the languages were not mixed, not allowing the girl to insert russian words during a conversation in english. when bella was 10-month-old, her parents added french. she could not talk but could point her finger at things when adults referred to them. bella mastered reading even before she began to talk, and her parents taught this using special cards from the age of five months. for example, when ten-month-old bella was shown the word \"hand\" written in russian or english, she showed her little hand. by the age of one, she and her parents mastered 60 such cards. bella began to read easily at the age of two. chinese cartoons by the age of two bella learned to speak in short sentences and read fluently in three languages. when she was just under three, her parents added chinese to her program. according to the mother, bella showed great interest in the new language, and she asked to watch cartoons in chinese. at the age of three years and two months, little bella showed an interest in learning spanish and german, as well as dancing, violin and vocals. then arabic was also added. bella walks, plays hide and seek, and reads ordinary books for children – she just does it in different languages. all her classes are held in the form of a game. the parents organize small educational excursions with native speakers for bella, she also attends an english theater club, studies drawing in french, dancing in spanish, and attends figure skating lessons with a native german speaker. in addition, the parents regularly organize joint language classes for bella and her friends who are also brought up in a multilingual environment. brain power scientists confirm that the ability to speak in different languages, and switch from one to the other, depends on the interaction of different areas of the brain. they are activated depending on the language's phonetic characteristics, its grammatical system, imagery and even tonality. \"every new experience is reflected in the brain by the emergence of new nerve connections,\" said psychologist tatyana dyachenko. \"the hippocampus, responsible for memory, stimulates the growth of new neurons. the volume of certain parts of the brain literally grows.'' \"multilingualism has a positive effect on a child's overall development, though it may cause a lag in the development of speech at an early stage in comparison with children who grow up with only one language,\" said kira ivanova, an expert at the institute of linguistic studies (ils) in the russian

our mailing list facebook this powerful corporate lobby is quietly backing hillary — and nobody’s talking about it carey wedlercarey wedler | antimedia over the course of the 2016 presidential election, americans who rail against hillary clinton have condemned the media’s bias in her favor — and rightfully so. clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media — whose parent companies often donate to her — with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. but as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind hillary clinton – and hardly anyone is talking about it. though outrage over clinton’s corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like goldman sachs , citibank, jp morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks. when people think of hollywood’s support for a political campaign, their minds tend to focus on the entertainment industry’s most visible figures — celebrities. from george clooney , katy perry, and leonardo dicaprio to justin timberlake, reese witherspoon, steven spielberg, beyonce, and jay-z, the celebrity consensus this year has settled on clinton. but underneath the stars’ ‘progressive’ choice is an intentional, systematic machine working in hillary’s favor, and it mirrors other conglomerated industries that have aligned behind her. moguls with millions (and billions) back hillary and the clinton family the first layer of clinton’s corporate hollywood allegiance is rather simple to peel back, simply because hillary’s top industry donors make no secret of their support. earlier this year, george clooney held a $100,000-a-plate fundraiser for clinton, one that earned $15 million dollars — far more than goldman sachs has collectively donated to her campaign. the actor’s event raised money for the hillary victory fund, which was recently revealed to be an avenue for maxed out donors to contribute more than the allowable amount. the victory fund has also been criticized for hoarding money for hillary that was supposed to go to state democratic parties. clooney teamed up with one of corporate hollywood’s most powerful executives, jeffrey katzenberg, for this fundraiser. katzenberg rose to prominence at walt disney in the 1990s, where he helmed some of the millennial generation’s favorite childhood films: beauty and the beast , aladdin , the lion king , and the little mermaid were all products of katzenberg’s leadership. several years later, he partnered with steven spielberg (also a longtime clinton supporter) and david geffen, a music mogul, to create dreamworks animation. katzenberg was the top bundler for barack obama in 2012 and also funded him in 2008, so it’s unsurprising the president takes his phone calls. further, katzenberg’s right-hand man, andy spahn, visited the white house almost 50 times during obama’s first term, mother jones reported at the time, enjoying a close relationship with the president — and some economic benefits. katzenberg, who recently earned $391 million on the sale of dreamworks to comcast, has donated at least $1 million to clinton’s campaign this election season. then there’s billionaire haim saban, the staunchly pro-israel entertainment mogul behind the original power rangers series. he is clinton’s top individual donor, besting katzenberg, with at least $6.4 million in donations to her campaign. he has contributed $15 million to the clinton foundation, and his wife, cheryl, serves on the board. saban has supported the clintons since the 1990s, and during bill’s time in office, he enjoyed the business perks of being friends with the president of the united states, as mother jones has detailed . his investments are tied to wall street, and he has also enjoyed clinton’s condemnation of boycott, sanction, divest, a nonviolent, market-based global protest movement challenging israel’s occupation of palestine. both men, therefore, know well the perks of having friends in high places — and both are some of the top donors of any candidate in the 2016 race. but their very public— and lavish — support barely scratches the surface of the real machinations taking place between hollywood’s corporate underbelly and its stake in american politics. the studio lobby most people, if they’ve heard of the motion picture association of america (mpaa) at all, know it as the organization that rates films. it’s the familiar, almost comforting disclaimer that appears before a trailer or film, ranking it g, pg, pg-13, r, or in some cases, nc-17. though the organization has its roots in the 20th century, founded as an effort to self-regulate their content, more than anything, it is corporate hollywood’s lobby. the mpaa represents 20th century fox (owned by rupert murdoch’s news corp.), warner brothers (owned by time warner), disney, universal (owned in part by comcast), sony pictures, and paramount pictures (news corp, time warner, and comcast have all contributed to the clinton foundation). for some, it’s difficult to place corporate hollywood in the same category as more reviled industries like banking, weapons manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals . this is likely, at least in part, because they deliver one of america’s favorite pastimes — entertainment. yet the revolving door is strong, as is the mpaa’s political foundation. in fact, the mpaa’s longest running chairman was jack valenti , who served as an advisor to lyndon b. johnson before taking over the lobbying group. by 2011, former senator and presidential candidate, chris dodd, had taken the reins. dodd, who makes $3 million a year working as the organization’s top lobbyist, takes his job seriously. as the los angeles times reported , dodd has increased lobbying funds and efforts in congress. “ we’ve had a hundred meetings with new members of congress since november ,” he told the publication last year. dodd is a clinton supporter. he officially endorsed her earlier this year. disney chairman bob iger is also a huge clinton supporter and member of the mpaa. alongside saban, iger hosted a hollywood fundraiser for her in august and held a meeting with tim kaine, clinton’s running mate, in september. on that same trip, kaine met with warner brothers executive kevin tsujihara, who donated to hillary clinton’s victory fund this year. he met with fox television executive dana walden, who also donated to clinton. he also met with kevin reilly, an executive at turner, which is owned by time warner, which owns warner brothers and cnn , an outlet condemned for heavily favoring clinton this election cycle. perhaps these private meetings were about gun control and equal rights. or, perhaps, kaine and the executives discussed business interests. either way, the paper trail gets more decisive — and more revealing. what is the mpaa hoping to achieve? mpaa members disney and sony have independently advocated for the trans-pacific partnership deal , the globally loathed trade agreement criticized for granting carte blanche to corporations and stripping nations of their sovereignty. disney has even prodded its employees to contribute lobbying funds in support of the agreement. fox, disney, time warner, comcast, and other media companies have lobbied in favor of tpp . one of tpp’s most dangerous provisions is its intent to regulate copyright and intellectual property in favor of corporations – one of corporate hollywood’s main objectives. dodd is, unsurprisingly, a proponent of internet censorship legislation, which corporate hollywood invariably backs in its attempts to preserve its copyright profits. hollywood studios have been some of the biggest proponents of heavy internet regulation (with regard to copyright) and have waged campaigns against online piracy. the mpaa’s website claims “the most serious threat” to the film industry is online copyright theft. it makes sense, then, that the mpaa would be a member of the u.s. business coalition for tpp . this massive trade group spent $658 billion dollars on lobbying in 2014, according to common cause, a left-leaning nonprofit lobbying organization. the coalition includes members like goldman sachs, citigroup, jp morgan, dow chemical , pfizer , glaxosmithkline , boeing , and viacom (another media behemoth). interestingly, the coalition’s website no longer lists its members, though anti-media easily accessed an archived version of that information. these corporations, or their employees, have also donated funds to hillary clinton in one way or another, often via the clinton foundation, which has been documented to issue favors to entities that contribute funds. dozens of media corporations have donated to the foundation. and — surprise, surprise — the only presidential candidate the mpaa has contributed to in 2016 is … hillary clinton. while it’s certainly the case that hollywood executives lean liberal and many undoubtedly support clinton due to a misguided moral imperative to stop donald trump, it would be naive to presume this is the only dynamic at play. this dynamic is evident in a letter from mpaa chief counsel steven fabrizio to disney’s alan braverman, among others, assuring them of his efforts to pass the bill. “ finally, in regard to trade ,” he wrote , “ the mpaa/mpa with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-ip trade policies such as tpp and the proposed eu/us trade agreement (ttip). ” braverman donated to clinton this year. infiltrating the dnc platform drafting committee most damning is the fact that one mpaa lobbyist, former california congressman howard berman, ended up on the drafting committee for the democratic platform this year (throughout the course of his political career, some of his top donors were hollywood studios). according to an email released by wikileaks, berman met with now-disgraced former dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz in may of this year — two months before he helped draft the platform. she appointed him to the platform drafting committee. that platform was widely criticized for refusing to condemn and reject tpp outright, as bernie sanders and his camp attempted to do. berman helped vote down language against tpp. “but hillary opposes tpp!” some might argue. indeed, after claiming it was set to be the “gold standard” of trade agreements, she changed her mind and said she opposed it. but a leak from the recently released john podesta batch showed there is a very strong chance she will change her mind, again, once elected. and considering donald trump’s anti-trade deal rhetoric against both nafta and tpp (not to mention his incendiary rhetoric), it makes little sense for corporate hollywood to back trump — even if they’re partly responsible for his meteoric rise via the apprentice . in a vein similar to berman’s, a former mpaa (and disney, and dow, and citigroup) lobbyist, jose villareal, now serves as the clinton campaign’s treasurer. though there is no smoking gun proving corporate hollywood is backing clinton with the express intent of ensuring passage of the trans-pacific partnership, it’s telling that the mpaa’s homepage is a tribute to tpp (and, naturally, themselves). it’s telling that the organization donated to only one presidential candidate. it’s telling that executives within these corporations are supporting clinton while the companies they represent heavily back tpp — and in many cases, clinton. it’s telling that their parent corporations, like news corp and time warner , are backing her — and the tpp. considering six corporations control 90% of media in the united states and clinton continually proves her loyalties to big business, it’s hardly surprising she’s the choice of corporate hollywood. and it’s likely they’ll expect favors in return. as dodd said following president obama’s rejection of sopa and pipa following public outcry in 2012: “candidly, those who count on quote ‘hollywood’ for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who’s going to stand up for them when their job is at stake…don’t ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don’t pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.” controversial dna search helps nab the 'grim sleeper' serial killer wed, 26 oct 2016 20:35 utc he roamed the streets of sacramento for six years, raping women as they walked to work or headed home from parties in the dark. to keep them from fighting back, he smashed their heads with rocks and wrapped his hands around their necks. sometimes he threatened them with a gun. police became frustrated, unable to identify him even though they had his dna from the crimes. desperate for a break, they checked a database of convicted felons, but came up empty-handed. finally, they searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database. they got lucky — the man had a brother in custody, which led authorities to the assailant. the \"roaming rapist\" is one of a handful of cases that california authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender dna database for a father, son or brother of an elusive crime suspect. the state's early success using familial dna searches to identify the so-called \"grim sleeper\" serial killer led los angeles police chief charlie beck to predict that the method would \"change the way policing is done in the united states.\" civil liberty groups expressed alarm, saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns. some questioned their legality. since then, familial dna has made more modest progress than beck predicted but has also gained wider respect. eight other states have followed california's lead, formally embracing the technique as a crime-fighting tool. and though many opponents still express concerns, california's approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state's strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes. using the method helped detectives in the state identify two murderers, including the grim sleeper, and five men wanted for sexual assaults, according to the attorney general's office. early last year, authorities arrested a san diego county man accused of sneaking into children's bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them. a few months later, a vacaville man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path. a santa cruz county judge in 2013 sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a walk-in refrigerator. lab officials look for a relative by scanning genetic profiles in the offender database and looking for dna samples that match with a suspect's along several, but not all, markers. from there, california's testing method focuses on part of the y-chromosome passed down along the male line, identifying father-son or full brother relationships. as more genetic markers for people's dna are entered into offender databases, the technology will become more precise, said geneticist frederick bieber, a professor at harvard university 's medical school and a leading authority on the technique. that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who aren't in the system, he said. \"the technology is powerful...there's demonstrable success,\" bieber said. britain pioneered the use of familial dna for crime solving more than a decade ago. in one of the earliest cases, detectives reopened the 1988 killing of a 20-year-old woman in wales and compared dna from the assailant to genetic profiles in britain's database of known offenders. in 2002, they got a partial match to a 14-year-old boy. the teen wasn't alive at the time of the slaying, but detectives used the clue to focus on his uncle, who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder. despite that conviction and others, the technology took some time to catch on in the u.s. and was used only sporadically. among its earliest uses was the 2005 kansas arrest of dennis rader, the btk serial killer, which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter's pap smear taken at a medical clinic. © travis heying / los angeles times a familial dna test led to the arrest of dennis l. rader, shown making a court appearance via video feed, in the btk (\"bind, torture and kill\") serial murder case in kansas. by 2007, an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in sacramento. gov. jerry brown — then the state's attorney general — began fielding letters and visits from prosecutors, urging him to consider using familial dna. his advisers, however, were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds. in 2008, brown enacted a comprehensive familial dna policy — making california the first state in the country to do so. under the policy, familial dna is only to be used as a \"last resort\" when all other investigative angles have been exhausted. so far, the state department of justice has run 156 familial searches, many of them repeat queries, such as in the grim sleeper case. an initial search turned up nothing, but state officials ran another scan in 2010. a partial match came back to a man added to the database after a 2008 arrest for firearm and drug offenses. detectives zeroed in on the man's father, lonnie franklin jr., who lived close to where many of the victims' bodies were dumped in south l.a. detectives believe franklin killed at least 25 women over more than two decades . he was sentenced to death in august. nabbing franklin changed things for now-ucla law school dean jennifer mnookin, who once condemned using dna to find suspects by searching for relatives. mnookin argued that the method invades privacy rights and is racially discriminatory because african americans and latinos are disproportionately represented in dna databases. although she still worries about the racial disparity, she said her view shifted after seeing the effect on big cases, such as franklin's, and how infrequently the technology is used. \"if it's helping us solve big cases,\" mnookin said, \"it seems like a worthwhile trade-off.\" eight other states — colorado, wisconsin, virginia, michigan, texas, wyoming, utah and florida — have protocols for the use of familial dna, and the technology has also been used informally by agencies elsewhere. but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy advocates, such as steve mercer, chief attorney for the forensic division of the maryland office of the public defender. mercer successfully lobbied for his state's formal ban on familial searches. washington, d.c., is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright. searching for relatives through partial matches is intrusive, he said, and raises concerns about the 4th amendment's prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure. \"it is a slippery slope,\" he said. critics also warn that partial matches can point authorities to innocent people. in 2014, the technology led police in an idaho city to wrongfully suspect a new orleans filmmaker of committing a notorious 1996 murder. police homed in on him after examining an online database of genetic profiles. one profile, which was a near match to dna left at the crime scene, belonged to a man who had donated his dna years earlier to a hereditary studies project conducted by the mormon church. an ancestry research company purchased the program's database, making it publicly available. idaho falls police obtained a court order compelling the company to turn over the identity of the man, who detectives thought could be related to the killer. once they had his name, they scrubbed his family and focused on the man's son, michael usry. detectives flew to new orleans and interrogated him for more than three hours, before ordering him to provide a cheek swab. usry asked whether someone he knew had committed a heinous crime. no, the detectives told him, they were looking at him. he waited anxiously for a month, wondering whether he'd be wrongfully arrested. finally, an email came. \"mr. usry,\" it read, \"your dna did not match with our case. sorry for the inconvenience.\" the science is complicated and his experience shows it isn't the \"perfect system\" some supporters make it out to be, said usry, now 37 and living in colorado. \"i'm still just scratching my head,\" he said. \"civil rights are being taken from us at an alarming rate.\" still, supporters of familial dna searches point to its successes. sacramento's \"roaming rapist,\" dereck sanders, spent 14 years on the loose, attacking women in the late-1990s and early-2000s. he sexually assaulted 10 victims, including two teenagers,14 and 15, who sneaked out one night to meet up with friends. officials ran his dna and began trailing sanders, whose brother — a convicted rapist — was in the offender dna database. sacramento sheriff's deputies followed him to a mcdonald's drive-thru, where he ordered a happy meal, and then to a park where he ate and threw away his trash. detectives retrieved the garbage and took it back to the county's crime lab. there, officials tested the dna from a straw sanders had used. it was a match. \"that was one of the happiest meals we ever had,\" said rob gold, the supervising deputy district attorney who prosecuted sanders. \"it would not have been solved without familial dna.\" sanders' 14-year-old victim, who is now 33, said the rape destroyed her for years. she obsessed over maintaining control in all situations and felt paranoid. she watched until her girlfriends walked into their homes and shut the door behind them, but still found herself texting them to double-check that they were safe. ( the times generally does not identify victims of sex crimes.) she got counseling and tried to understand the different ways the rape had affected her. still, the same two questions often came to mind. is he hurting anyone else, she wondered? will i ever get the chance to look him in the eye? the answer came in the fall of 2014 at sanders' trial, where she testified against him. he was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault and sentenced to life in prison. to her, the question of whether to use the technology is almost silly. \"it's out there, it's available,\" she said. \"do it.\" authorities in california have used familial dna searches to solve several murder and sexual assault cases: lonnie franklin jr. the \"grim sleeper\" serial killer prowled the streets of south l.a. for more than two decades. after getting a partial dna hit to his son in 2010, authorities charged franklin with killing nine women and a teenage girl. he was convicted earlier this year and sentenced to death. elvis garcia a man sexually assaulted a barista in a santa cruz coffee shop in 2008, threatening her with a knife and barricading her inside a walk-in refrigerator. in 2011, a partial hit to the assailant's father led police to garcia, who was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 65 years to life in prison. james brown the 1978 slaying of a 26-year-old woman in an orange county parking lot remained unsolved for three decades until familial dna helped lead authorities to brown, who died in 1996 and had been cremated. forensic scientists used a dna sample from his son to confirm brown was the killer. dereck sanders beginning in the late 1990s, the \"roaming rapist\" sexually assaulted women and girls across sacramento county. sheriff's deputies arrested sanders in 2012 after a crime lab got a partial hit to his brother, a convicted rapist. sanders is serving life in prison. michael simpson in 2002, a man raped and beat a 55-year-old woman behind a store in sunnyvale. using a familial dna search, police identified simpson as a suspect. he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. gilbert chavarria during a heat wave in the summer of 2013, when many people left their windows cracked open, a san diego county man snuck into the bedrooms of six children and cut holes in their pajamas before molesting them. authorities said a familial dna hit ultimately led them to arrest chavarria. he has pleaded not guilty. jeremy delaunay in the summer of 2014, a teenager in vacaville sexually assaulted a woman along a bike path before stealing her jewelry. a year later, authorities arrested delaunay. he is serving six years in prison after pleading guilty to rape. trump and clinton choice impacting global markets trump and clinton choice

then frigging oppose russian policy. do something real. don’t just skitter around like the village idiot tagging russia and then running away.] on thursday, malta withdrew permission for a russian navy replenishment tanker to refuel at its port. uk and american diplomats had applied pressure to the maltese government to deny access to the tanker, as they believed the fuel would be used to replenish the admiral kuznetsov battlegroup. the carrier and seven accompanying vessels are believed to be headed to syria to support the siege of aleppo. earlier this week, spain cancelled permission for the kuznetsov’s auxiliaries to take on fuel at the north african port territory of ceuta. the spanish government had come under intense diplomatic pressure to deny access to the russian vessels. russian officials say that the kuznetsov battlegroup carries enough supplies to be self-sustaining for at least 45 days, and several military spokespeople denied that they had ever asked for formal permission to call at ceuta or malta. this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for isaac davisposted on october 30, 2016 by isaac davis the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. but, as the saying goes, water is life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself. when the police and national guard attack u.s. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren, ceo of energy transfer partners, the company responsible for the project. so who is kelcy warren? a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering, warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of energy transfer equity in 2007. with business partner ray davis, co-owner of the texas rangers baseball team, warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nation’s largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. the company’s holdings include sunoco, southern union and regency energy partners. forbes estimates the 60-year-old warren’s personal wealth at $4 billion. bloomberg described him as “among america’s new shale tycoons” — but rather than building a fortune by drilling he “takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until it’s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.” [ source ] shockingly, in 2015 the governor of texas, greg abbott, appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project . “according to the governor’s office, the state parks and wildlife commission “manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas,” along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans.” [ source ] this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post. his petition is described here : most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline. the dallas-based billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river, just north of the standing rock sioux reservation. no environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. a similar story is unfolding out in west texas, where warren’s company has split through the pristine big bend region with the 200 mile comanche trail pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile trans pecos pipeline. these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region. with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who

property as she tried to block dakota access pipeline construction equipment from crossing her land. once again, the repression of those against the dakota access pipeline (dapl) is heating up, with 127 activists arrested in north dakota over the weekend. however, north dakota isn’t the only place where protests over the dakota access pipeline are coming to a head. in iowa, farmers have had their land seized by the company behind the pipeline, energy transfer partners, through the use of eminent domain. eminent domain has been legal in the us since 1888, thanks to the passage of the condemnation act . the law authorizes the federal government to take private property for public use. however, in 1906, the law was amended to allow for the seizure of private property even if it only benefited private parties (e.g., corporations), not the public. the argument for this was that corporate seizure of private land “helps” the public through economic development. yet, what the law essentially means is that even your own land doesn’t belong to you if the government or government-supported corporations want it. a sad, yet accurate example of eminent domain gone wrong took place last week in calhoun county, iowa. cyndy coppola was arrested over the weekend on her own property for trying to block access to dapl trucks from hauling pipeline construction materials through her land. dapl first received access to coppola’s farm through the use of eminent domain, which granted energy transfer partners easements to her property. coppola remarked that watching the morally wrong seizure of the farm she worked so hard for was difficult to handle. “it was very frustrating, and when i first saw that topsoil piled up when they started digging, my first reaction was to cry, because we’ve tried everything.” coppola, as well as nine other local farmers, are suing energy transfer partners for the seizure of their property. they are arguing that the move stands in complete violation of iowa state law. the pipeline has generated controversy for most of this year, inspiring the largest gathering of native american tribes in recent history to fight the project. they, as well as environmental activists, argue that the pipeline will poison the water and destroy the sacred sites of the standing rock sioux tribe. the evidence stands on their side, as the company that will be tasked with managing the pipeline after its construction has been responsible for more leaks than any of their competitors, with over 200 recorded leaks since 2010. the most recent of these happened over the weekend when a sunoco pipeline leaked 55,000 gallons of gasoline into one of the nation’s most endangered rivers. even the un has officially condemned the project, asking the us federal government to end the project immediately. however, the federal government is openly supporting the crackdown on protestors, as well as journalists who are covering the story. democracy now’s amy goodman was charged with “participating in a riot” just for reporting on the issue. though those charges were eventually dropped, the north dakota state attorney who initially charged her has vowed to look for new reasons to criminalize goodman’s reporting. goodman said that these actions send a chilling message to journalists, “don’t come to north dakota.” the dakota access pipeline has proved, without a doubt, that private interests are the real beneficiaries of federal policy, allowing them to take what’s lawfully yours and even arrest you just for standing on your own property.

: first, the fbi director, james b. comey, put himself enthusiastically forward as the arbiter of not only whether to prosecute a criminal case — which is not the job of the fbi — but also best practices in the handling of email and other matters. now, he has chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness , departing from the department’s traditions. from the second piece by notorious mud-slinger dana milbank: i’ve long believed in comey’s integrity. but if he doesn’t step forward and explain his october surprise, he may inadvertently wind up interfering in the political process — perhaps even reversing the outcome of a presidential election — in a way that would have made j. edgar hoover gape. and the third strike : fbi director james b. comey’s stunning announcement that he has directed investigators to begin reviewing new evidence in the clinton email investigation was yet another troubling violation of long-standing justice department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nation’s chief investigative official . back to the july 7 editorial: “it appears damage is being done to the rule of law,” mr. ryan said. he’s right, but the fbi director isn’t doing the damage. the wreckers are those who cast baseless aspersions on u.s. law enforcement in the service of their partisan goals . i for one believe that comey was wrong in july and is right today. he should have pressed for charges against clinton early on. using a \"secret\" private email server for confidential state business is not legal and would have been out of bounds for anyone else. now possible new evidence was found and must be investigated. it is not comey's job to ask if the timing of a renewed investigation is convenient for the potential culprit. he also had to inform congress because he had reasonably promised to do so. (he also needed to save his ass before anyone else in his department talked to the media.) the so called \"election\" of a u.s. president is always a sorry show. but this season's version has at least some amusing moments. seeing the hypocrites at fred hyatt's funny pages™ squirm is one of them. it makes me smirk. posted by b on october 30, 2016 at 08:37 am | permalink a nation ‘wrecked’ by immigration: a civil war is brewing as do-gooding swedes turn against muslim migrants’ violence, rapes and murders adminby rebecca perring for years sweden has regarded itself as a “humanitarian

and the death of social worker alexandra mezher , 22, who was knifed to death at an asylum centre for unaccompanied children at the hands of a somalian migrant who claimed he was 15. at the time, her grieving mother, an immigrant herself from the middle east said: “immigration has destroyed sweden.” sweden, a country of 9.8million, took 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015. the influx included 35,400 unaccompanied minors – nine times more than 2015. but nothing could prepare stockholm for the rise in crime and an abuse of the criminal system. and so much so, a nation, which once prided itself on giving a warm welcome to outsiders, has reported a rise in arson attacks against migrant shelters, while support for the right-wing swedish democrats has surged. in january, authorities were forced to

under fire for withholding ‘carcinogenic glyphosate’ documents adan salazarwho cancer agency under fire for withholding ‘carcinogenic glyphosate’ documents iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review rt.com - october 27, 2016 comments the international agency for research on cancer (iarc), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on “probably carcinogenic” glyphosate. the iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to reuters. the agency told reuters on tuesday that it tried to protect the study from “external interference,” as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was “the sole owner of such materials.” the scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under us freedom of information laws. the groundbreaking review, published in march 2015 by the iarc – a semi-autonomous agency of the world health organization (who) – labeled the glyphosate herbicide as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” glyphosate is a key ingredient of monsanto’s flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name ‘roundup.’ it is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified “roundup ready” crops, also produced by monsanto. the iarc’s report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. the report sparked a heated debate around the use of roundup, and caused several eu countries – including france, sweden, and the netherlands – to object to the renewal of the glyphosate’s eu license. the vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in june 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. the controversial report has seemingly made the iarc a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the iarc’s evaluations are fuel for “unnecessary health scares,” since the iarc allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a “typical human” exposure to it. it remained unclear whether the critics urged a who body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. the critics also brought up other controversial statements from the iarc, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. the agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and…freedom from conflicts of interest.” numerous freedom of information requests by the energy & environment legal institute (e&e legal), a us conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. e&e legal told reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the iarc or to the us federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. basically, it’s being decided whether the iarc, as part of the who, is truly independent and free from “conflicts of interest.” according to reuters, officials from the us national institutes of health (nih) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why american taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. “iarc’s standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,” a letter from us oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz to nih director francis collins states, as quoted by reuters. the oversight committee demanded a full disclosure of nih funding of the iarc, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency’s activities. iarc opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. the european food safety authority (efsa), which believes glyphosate is “unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,” promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its “commitment to open risk assessment.” the food safety watchdog made this statement in late september, and still has to deliver the promised information. newsletter sign up get the latest

markets causing a drop of almost 1% in early trading, with major indices in london, new york and germany coming sharply off monday’s highs. the bank of england and the us federal reserve both rushed to reassure markets with statements confirming that interest rate hikes were ‘off the table’ until stability had been reestablished and the bar had the correct number of triangles again. meanwhile, reports from europe indicate that several countries have mobilised troops to mass on the swiss border as international tensions were heightened by the change, with the united states ‘exploring

7 years, it seems that michael jackson’s name has just been dragged back into the spotlight once again. unfortunately for his family, it looks like bad news for the star’s estate as a woman leaked the $900,000 sex secret he had kept quiet for a whopping 30 years – and she has proof. most people are aware of jackson’s depraved past involving children – specifically, little boys. however, the most recent person to come forward is actually a woman, who states that the deceased star had molested and sexually assaulted her about 3 decades prior. according to la times , “the alleged abuse started in 1986 and occurred in such iconic locations as neverland ranch, the set of ‘moonwalker,’ jackson’s encino mansion, and in the back of the singer’s limousine, according to papers filed tuesday in los angeles county superior court.” unfortunately for the family and jackson’s estate, her word isn’t all the accuser was armed with . stock image of michael jackson’s “neverland” ranch among the court filings are scanned copies of checks purportedly paid to her from jackson or his entertainment companies, which she says were issued to pay her off in exchange for her silence. in all, the checks totaled a whopping $900,000 – a damning number to say the least. furthermore, the largest sum, a check for $600,000, was dated in late 1993, which just so happens to be three months after jackson found himself in yet another lawsuit, that time with a 13-year-old boy saying he had been molested by the king of pop. of course, the payment comes at a time where jackson would have wanted to ensure that all of his other skeletons remained perfectly quiet in his closet. oddly enough, this is the only time a female victim has come forward to allege a jackson sexual assault. in addition to that, the woman’s lawyer, vince finaldi, said the case offers the first evidence that jackson and his production company — not an insurance carrier — made direct payments to an alleged abuse victim. michael jackson (source: la times ) the abuse allegedly lasted for over 3 years, beginning when the girl was merely 12 years old and ending just after her 15 th birthday. la times adds: the woman alleges that for about three years, jackson fondled her, forced her to orally copulate him, and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her, which caused her to bleed, the lawsuit states. jackson also supplied her with gifts and letters, and two of the notes were attached to the lawsuit. one of the letters ends, “i’m crazy about you. … all my love, michael.” of course, the jackson family lawyer is saying that the entire ordeal is a made-up claim meant to do nothing more than leech off of the star’s estate. as the woman – being a sex assault victim – and her identity are being kept quiet for the time being, it’s hard to say whether she’s looking for a payout or something more. although this man is dead and buried, and under most circumstances should be left to rest in peace, no sex assault victim should ever go without justice. although money is a good way to buy silence, it certainly does not equate to anything near justice. in fact, it represents the exact opposite as it proves that if you have enough money, you can get away with anything – even sexually abusing a child. this woman deserves her day in court, and it certainly doesn’t look like the jackson family is going to like the end result. racist conservatives cheer after hannity tells obama to go back to africa and stay there share on facebook unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past couple-hundred years, you’ve heard at least one person complain that black people need to go “back to africa.” even the president of the united states, unfortunately, is not immune to this treatment. for years, barack obama has weathered a barrage of race-based hatred, with people who would become trump’s basket of deplorables calling him “monkey” and “ape” and “n*gger”— and, yes, complaining that president obama (who was born in hawaii) needs to go “back to africa.” in this case, deplorable fox news contributor sean hannity told the president to get on a plane to kenya after the election and never return. “i have an offer for the president. i will charter a plane for you and your family,” hannity said on his radio show. “i will charter it to the country of your choice. you want to go to canada? i’ll pay for you to go to canada. you want to go to kenya? i’ll pay for you to go to kenya. jakarta, where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there.” “i will charter donald trump’s plane if he’ll let me,” hannity added, noting that there is “one stipulation”—“you can’t come back!” naturally, this message of “go back to africa and stay there” resonated with conservatives, with many chiming in to offer their own suggestions on right-wing lie-factory western journalism’s comment section . some suggested he be flown to guantanamo bay to be tortured for 50 years. others suggested outright assassination. one man even made a creepy remark about stalking malia obama in the bathroom: all of these people will be voting for mr. deplorable on november 28. make sure you’re out there on november 8, when it’s actually election day. listen to hannity’s remarks below: featured image via screengrab/getty images(chip somodevilla) related written by john prager john prager is an

bond donald trump is mostly bad news for africa, including reduced u.s. aid and possibly more support for “imperial african adventurism\" – unless, of course, africa uses trump’s lemons to make lemonade. his isolationism “could give africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.” on climate policy, trump is an unmitigated disaster. what does a trump victory mean for africa? by patrick bond this article previously appeared in pambazuka news . “ trump will sabotage the un framework convention on climate change and similar strategies to solve global problems.” the most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. this is because trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. africa will be the most adversely affected continent. united nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary african deaths by then, according to christian aid. under trump, we can safely predict that washington will no longer seek to control united nations climate negotiations, as did barack obama’s administration. the wikileaks clinton emails and state department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the copenhagen and durban climate summits. instead, trump will simply pull the us out of the 2015 paris agreement, as did george w. bush from the kyoto protocol. by good fortune, the un framework convention on climate change annual summit is underway this week in morocco. the only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the us state department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries – the us especially – which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. “trump will simply pull the us out of the 2015 paris agreement, as did george w. bush from the kyoto protocol.” trump also heralds a rise in us racism and xenophobia, parallel to the brexit vote by the british white working class. in neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither trump nor theresa may (uk prime minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. and african elites who have – with a few exceptions – climbed over each other to please washington, won’t find themselves welcome in the white house. hopefully the contagion of trump’s racism – which will make life for africans much harder – will be met by a major resistance movement including africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the us – women, african-americans, latinos, muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. this movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. what are the likely economic consequences? consistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. in the case of africa, trump is likely to retract benefits under the africa growth and opportunity act and reduce us aid. that isolationism, in turn, could give africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. trump’s hatred of what he terms the “globalists” is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. it’s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. the “neoliberal” group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with trump and favored hillary clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. they will ensure that the continuing us dominance in western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. we can simply anticipate more brazen us self-interest, as witnessed during the ronald reagan and george w. bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by obama and his allies. what us policies on africa are likely to change? with what impact? to be frank, we can only offer guesses. trump said literally nothing about africa during his campaign. he wants to “rebuild us military power,” which might include strengthening the pentagon’s controversial africa command, known as africom. economically, it is worth noting trump’s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via vice president mike pence. this suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for african adventurism will be served well by trump’s bully-boy mentality. what does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect africa? the us’s role in the international monetary fund (imf) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his imf executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on africa using washington’s veto power. the leaders of two big african economies are desperate for imf credits: nigeria ($29 billion) and egypt ($12 billion). in relation to the united nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the un leadership now sitting in trump’s manhattan east side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move un headquarters out of the us? trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are muslims, libyans, syrians and mexicans – amongst others – so holding multilateral events in the us may soon be impossible. the period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. the first is that trump will sabotage the un framework convention on climate change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that obama painstakingly reached with iran earlier this year. and the second is that three of the brics’ nationalistic leaders – vladimir putin in russia, nahendra modi in india and michel temer in brazil – can be expected to establish much closer ties to trump. this is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of pakistan, turkey and the philippines away from washington. trump’s hatred of china is another indeterminate factor. regardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it’s time for a ‘multilateralism-from-below’ in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we’ve seen in living memory. patrick bond is director of the university of kwazulu-natal centre for civil society and a professor of political economy at the university of the witwatersrand. news: missed opportunity: president obama just found out that he was allowed to sleep in the white house after years of living in a hotel near the reagan airport email the president has to be kicking himself over this one. as his term in office comes to a close, it seems as if barack obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity. earlier today, the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the white house this whole time, after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by reagan national airport. sorry, mr. president, but it’s true. you really blew your chance on this one. having booked an extended stay at the airport hilton upon his inauguration back in 2009, barack and his family have resided in an atrium-view room with two double beds and complimentary wi-fi for the past eight years. but earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the white house, you could tell that obama hadn’t realized the choice was his to make until that very moment. yes, obama’s accomplished a lot over the years, but he’s got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. he would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the affordable care act if he hadn’t wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the oval office on the d.c. metro. there’s no doubt the countless hilton rewards points obama has accrued is a nice perk, but that doesn’t soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms. this is something obama is going to regret for a long time to come. “nobody ever explicitly told me that i could live there until now,” said a clearly disappointed obama, as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels. “while sasha and malia love being on the same floor as the pool here, i now wish we had stayed at the lavish, 20,000-square-foot private residence in the white house for the past eight years. one time in 2011, i slept underneath my desk after a late night, and i was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me. now i’m being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers. this sucks.” sorry, barry, but this one’s kind of on you. our advice to whoever the next president is? don’t miss your chance like he did. hidden in plain sight – the global depopulation agenda nathanial maukaoctober 26, 2016 “maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.” ~ georgia guidestones this is one of the first of ten commandments blazoned across the georgia guidestones, an occult monument for which no person or organization has taken credit. though the monument was commissioned by someone named r.c. christian more than two decades ago, the true identity of the person who built this specter is still unidentified, and the message is but one of the many examples of a cabalistic desire to cull the population. there are many more ‘hidden’ in plain sight. the georgie guidestones state : 1. maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. 2. guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity. 3. unite humanity with a living new language. 4. rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason. 5. protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. 6. let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. 7. avoid petty laws and useless officials. 8. balance personal rights with social duties. 9. prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite. 10.be not a cancer on the earth – leave room for nature – leave room for nature. though some of these commandments seem harmless enough, the very first describes the supreme sentiment of the mysterious group of masons who erected the stones. if you want further narrative for what they bode, you don’t have to look far. as stanford university professor, paul ehrlich , the author of the population bomb states , “the first task is population control at home. how do we go about it? many of my colleagues feel that some sort of compulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control. one plan often mentioned involves the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.” we can see clearly that the ‘elite’ class, intent on ridding the planet of its burdensome load, has already poisoned the water of 42 out of 50 states with lead . pesticides and fertilizers poison the remaining states’ water along with the original 42 states. male infertility is rising due to these contaminants, and premature births along with miscarriage are more common due to others. if the water doesn’t kill you, it will simply lobotomize you, or at least start the process. harvard medical has pronounced that fluoridated water lowered iq scores in children who drank it, and aluminum along with fluoride is a known neurotoxin, also contributing to the rising numbers of alzheimer’s, parkinsons, and similar neurodegenerative diseases. read: 11 common symptoms of the global depopulation slow kill should poisoning the water be insufficient to keep the population down, we can look to the advice of david brower, once executive director of the sierra club and founder of the friends of the earth. he suggests that, “childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license … all potential parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.” forced and coerced sterilization at the hands of the eugenics board and other bodies is nothing new. some investigators recently found that 148 female inmates in two california prisons were sterilized between 2006 to 2010 — and there may be 100 more incidents dating back to the late 1990s. one reporter wrote , “ the women were signed up for the surgery while they were pregnant and housed at either the california institution for women in corona or valley state prison for women in chowchilla, which is now a men’s prison. former inmates and prisoner advocates maintain that prison medical staff coerced the women, targeting those deemed likely to return to prison in the future. crystal nguyen, a former valley state prison inmate who worked in the prison’s infirmary during 2007, said she often overheard medical staff asking inmates who had served multiple prison terms to agree to be sterilized. “i was like, ‘oh my god, that’s not right,’” nguyen, 28, said. “ do they think they’re animals, and they don’t want them to breed anymore? ” today vaccines are used in a similar manner to help cull the population against their informed consent. eugenicist, bill gates tried to ‘ field test ’ his hpv vaccine in india on indigenous young girls, but the indian government eventually brought a stop to this. the rockefeller family also quietly funds vaccines that alter a woman’s hormones to make her less likely to become pregnant or to maintain a pregnancy. a book titled disciplining reproduction by adele e. clark explains what the elites were planning as early as the 1930s. “ other lines of current immunological contraceptive research continue to seek what, during the 1930s, max mason of the rockefeller foundation called “anti-hormones”: vaccines to block hormones needed for very early pregnancy and a vaccine to block the hormone needed for the surface of the egg to function properly .” barack obama’s top science advisor , john p. holdren has also said : “ a program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men . the development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. the capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.” a simple look at the peer-reviewed plos one site offers over 7,500 additional scientific articles that connect vaccines to sterilization. should vaccines or forced implants be insufficient to reduce the number of ‘useless eaters’ in the world, as henry kissinger has implied, then there is also the revealing text of dr. john colemann, who outlines the aims of a committee of 300, otherwise known as the original hierarchical organization to plan a new world order . among their plans are genocide, war, the installation of dictators, the legalization of drug use, and the normalizing of pornography : “to bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the pol pot regime in cambodia. it is interesting to note that pol pot’s genocidal plans were drawn up in the us by one of the club of rome’s research foundations, and overseen by thomas enders, a high-ranking state department official. it is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the pol pot butchers in cambodia. “….to cause by means of limited wars in the advanced countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the third world countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call ‘useless eaters.’ the committee of 300 (illuminati) commissioned cyrus vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. the paper was produced under the title “global 2000 report” and was accepted and approved for action by former president james earl carter, and edwin muskie, then secretary of state, for and on behalf of the us government. under the terms of the global 2000 report, the population of the us is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050. “……to encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an ‘art-form,’ which will be widely accepted and, eventually, become quite commonplace.” look no further than syria , iraq, afghanistan, turkey, and a myriad other examples of false flag terrorism . look no further than the top twenty pharmaceutical companies (all u.s., illuminati based ) that control almost 99 percent of the world’s massive, ‘legalized’ drug trade. see clearly, the genocide happening around the globe , and the child sex trafficking and pornography which is silently abided in hollywood, washington, and in every government circle run by cabal-funded individuals. look at the money usurped for the task of culling the masses, as former u.s. secretary of state and presidential nominee, hillary clinton has stated : “this year, the united states renewed funding of reproductive healthcare through the united nations population fund, and more funding is on the way. the u.s. congress recently appropriated more than $648 million in foreign assistance to family planning and reproductive health programs worldwide . that’s the largest allocation in more than a decade – since we last had a democratic president, i might add.” furthermore, weather modification, or geoengineering , also known as chemtrails , additionally help the slow kill , or fast degeneration of the human species. nasa has admitted to using these weather altering programs, so there is no sense denying their presence. aside from spraying lithium, strontium , barium, nano aluminum-coated fiberglass [known as chaff], radioactive thorium, cadmium, chromium, nickel, desiccated blood, mold spores, yellow fungus, and more, these chemical concoctions act as a global pandemic to further population control. without mention of contaminated food, darpa contrived control devices, and further attempts to make slaves of the remaining sheeple who live through these demonic efforts, know this; you are swimming in the depopulation agenda. the effects are all around you, and it is high time to put up some kind of resistance. via waking times image: sagesolar/flickr nathaniel mauka is a researcher of the dark side of government and exopolitics, and a staff writer for waking times . voters

us // 0 comments bernie sanders sent a letter to president barack obama on friday requesting that he intervene to protect native americans who have been peacefully protesting the dakota access pipeline. in a statement issued on his official u.s. senate website, sanders asked obama to halt construction of the pipeline until federal officials properly conduct a cultural and environmental review. recommended president barack obama has sneakily approved the construction of two new dakota pipelines just as the doj halted the construction on the existing one. (1 hour ago) at least 140 people were arrested at the construction site on wednesday after hundreds of police in riot gear moved in with tanks, using sound cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets. sanders.senate.gov reports: hundreds of native american protectors have gathered at the site since april to protest the pipeline’s construction on land they claim is tribal under the 1851 treaty of fort laramie. “i urge you to take all appropriate measures to protect the safety of the native americans protesters and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the construction of the pipeline,” sanders wrote in the letter. recommended bernie sanders joined protests in support of native american activists who are striving to stop construction of a north dakota pipeline. (1 hour ago) sanders asks that president obama direct the justice department to send observers to the site to protect protestors’ safety and first amendment rights; call north dakota governor jack dalrymple to remove the national guard from the protest camp; and direct the army corps of engineers to issue an order to stop work on construction of the pipeline near the protest site to reduce tensions while awaiting judicial action. sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline until the army corps of engineers completes a full cultural and environmental review. “it is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of native american communities,” sanders wrote. “mr. president, you took a bold and principled stand against the keystone pipeline – i ask you to take a similar stand against the dakota access pipeline.” sanders previously called on the president to block construction of the pipeline during a rally outside the white house with leaders of the standing rock sioux tribe and other tribal nations in september. announcement by the saker community

ethnic cleansing of palestine jeremy r. hammondreferences the debate it started when daniel blatman, an israeli historian and head of the institute for contemporary jewry at the hebrew university of jerusalem, penned an op-ed for the israeli daily haaretz stating that ethnic cleansing “is exactly what happened in 1948.” to support this, blatman cited benny morris: the israeli historian, blatman wrote, “determined that most of the arabs in the country, over 400,000, were encouraged to leave or expelled in the first stage of the war—even before the arab nations’ armies invaded.” [2] benny morris, october 30, 2007 ( aude / cc by-sa 2.0 ) that prompted a response from morris, who wrote an op-ed of his own titled “israel conducted no ethnic cleansing in 1948”. in it, he contends that blatman “distorts history when he says the new state of israel, a country facing invading armies, carried out a policy of expelling the local arabs.” and blatman “betrayed his profession”, morris further charged, “when he attributed to me things i have never claimed and distorted the events of the 1948 war.” central to morris’s argument is that “blatman ignores the basic fact that the palestinians were the ones who started the war when they rejected the un compromise plan and embarked on hostile acts in which 1,800 jews were killed between november 1947 and mid-may 1948.” moreover, the neighboring arab states had “threatened to invade even before the un resolution was passed on november 29, 1947, and before a single arab had been uprooted from his home.” even prior to the adoption of general assembly resolution 181, which recommended partitioning palestine into separate arab and jewish states, they arab states had continuously declared their intent “to attack the jewish state when the british left.” he acknowledges that prior to the zionists’ declaration of the existence of israel on may 14, 1948, and the subsequent introduction of arab states’ regular armies into the conflict, a few hundred thousand arabs (though a number “apparently smaller” than the figure of 400,000 cited by blatman) “were expelled from their homes and forced to flee”. how can it be true that, on one hand, hundreds of thousands of palestinians were forced from their homes and never allowed to return, yet also true, on the other, that there was no ethnic cleansing? morris attempts to reconcile the apparent contradiction by arguing that “at no stage of the 1948 war was there a decision by the leadership of the yishuv [the jewish community] or the state to ‘expel the arabs’”. in other words, it’s true that many arabs were indeed expelled, but this was not the result of an official policy of the zionist leadership. “it’s true that in the 1930s and early ‘40s”, morris further acknowledges, “david ben-gurion and chaim weizmann supported the transfer of arabs from the area of the future jewish state. but later they supported the un decision, whose plan left more than 400,000 arabs in place. “it’s also true that from a certain point during the war, ben-gurion let his officers understand that it was preferable for as few arabs as possible to remain in the new country, but he never gave them an order ‘to expel the arabs.’” and, true, there was an “atmosphere of transfer that prevailed in the country beginning in april 1948”, but this “was never translated into official policy—which is why there were officers who expelled arabs and others who didn’t. neither group was reprimanded or punished. “in the end, in 1948 about 160,000 arabs remained in israeli territory—a fifth of the population.” furthermore, “on march 24, 1948, israel galili, ben-gurion’s deputy in the future defense ministry and the head of the haganah, ordered all the haganah brigades not to uproot arabs from the territory of the designated jewish state. things did change in early april due to the yishuv’s shaky condition and the impending arab invasion. but there was no overall expulsion policy—here they expelled people, there they didn’t, and for the most part the arabs simply fled.” morris acknowledges that the zionist leadership in mid-1948 “adopted a policy of preventing the return of refugees”, but asserts this was “logical and just” on the grounds that these were the “same refugees who months and weeks earlier had tried to destroy the state in the making.” what happened in 1948 does not fit the definition of “ethnic cleansing”, morris concludes. the arab states, on the other hand, “carried out ethnic cleansing and uprooted all the jews, down to the last one, from any territory they captured in 1948”, while the jews “left arabs in place in haifa and jaffa”, among other places. [3] arabs leaving haifa as jewish forces enter the city ( public domain ) that wasn’t the end of the discussion. blatman responded in turn with an op-ed titled “yes, benny morris, israel did perpetrate ethnic cleansing in 1948”. in it, he writes that, “on march 10, 1948, the national haganah headquarters approved plan dalet, which discussed the intention of expelling as many arabs as possible from the territory of the future jewish state.” with regard to morris’s denial that what occurred fits the definition of “ethnic cleansing”, blatman quotes the prosecutor in the trial of radovan karadzic, a bosnian-serb leader convicted for the ethnic cleansing of muslims in bosnia: in ethnic cleansing . . . you act in such a way that in a given territory, the members of a given ethnic group are eliminated. . . . you have massacres. everybody is not massacred, but you have massacres in order to scare those populations. . . . naturally, the other people are driven away. they are afraid . . . and, of course, in the end these people simply want to leave. . . . they are driven away either on their own initiative or they are deported. . . . some women are raped and, furthermore, often times what you have is the destruction of the monuments which marked the presence of a given population . . . for instance, catholic churches or mosques are destroyed. in other words, contrary to morris’s argument, it doesn’t follow that, since there is no document in which the zionist leadership explicitly outlined a plan to expel all arabs or in which military commanders were instructed to do so, therefore what occurred was not ethnic cleansing. what the prosecutor describes is exactly what happened in 1948, blatman notes: “implied instructions, silent understandings, sowing fear among the population whose flight is the objective; the destruction of the physical presence left behind.” blatman quotes from morris’s book the birth of the palestinian refugee problem, 1947–1949 : the attacks of the haganah and the israel defense forces, expulsion orders, the fear of attacks and acts of cruelty on the part of the jews, the absence of assistance from the arab world and the arab higher committee, the sense of helplessness and abandonment, orders by arab institutions and commanders to leave and evacuate, in most cases was the direct and decisive reason for the flight—an attack by the haganah, irgun, lehi or the idf, or the inhabitants’ fear of such an attack. blatman adds, “the expulsions were not war crimes, says morris, because it was the arabs who started the war. in other words, hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who belong to the side that began the fighting have to be expelled. maybe morris would agree that the genocide carried out by the germans against the herero in 1904–1908 was justified since, after all, the herero began the rebellion against german colonialism in namibia.” [4] next to weigh in on the debate was steven klein, a haaretz editor and adjunct professor at tel aviv university’s international program in conflict resolution and mediation. klein notes how morris himself, in a 1988 essay titled “the new historiography”, had explained how under plan d, the zionist forces “cleared various areas completely of arab villages”, and how “jewish atrocities . . . and the drive to avenge past misdeeds also contributed significantly to the exodus.” a palestinian woman and child (source: hanini.org / cc by 3.0 ) and in his book righteous victims: a history of the zionist-arab conflict, 1881–2001 , “morris observed that ben-gurion’s views on ‘transfer as a legitimate solution to the arab problem’ did not change after he publicly declared support for forced expulsions in the 1930s, but that ‘he was aware of the need, for tactical reasons, to be discreet.’ thus, so it seemed, he explained how ben-gurion could be responsible for the expulsion of many of the 700,000 palestinian arabs without ever issuing an order to that effect.” then in a 2004 haaretz interview with journalist ari shavit, morris had said, “a jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 palestinians. therefore it was necessary to uproot them.” “morris, of course, is welcome to change his political view”, klein continues. “but he, like any other historian, must understand that he has left a paper trail that tells a substantially different narrative than the one he now advocates. the benny morris of 2016 seems to be doing what he once accused the ‘old historians’ of doing—interpreting history and downplaying israeli misdeeds in order to defend israel’s legitimacy.” [5] next to chime in on the debate was ehud ein-gil, who points out in his own haaretz op-ed that among the arabs who were allowed to remain were “15,000 druze who had allied with israel, 34,000 christians, whom israel treated decently so as not to anger its western allies, and some bedouin muslim villages, whose leaders had allied with israel or with their jewish neighbors. “of the 75,000 muslims who remained (less than 15 percent of the prewar number), tens of thousands were internally displaced—people who had fled their villages or were expelled from them and have not been allowed to return to their homes to this day.” “morris is right”, ein-gil continues, “when he mentions the ‘atmosphere of transfer’ that gripped israel from april 1948, but he errs when he claims that this atmosphere was never translated into official policy.” he quotes the orders given to commanders in plan d to either destroy villages or encircle and then mount “search-and-control operations” within them and, in the event of resistance, to expel all inhabitants. [6] finally, morris responded once more to his critics with a haaretz article titled “‘ethnic cleansing’ and pro-arab propaganda”, in which he characterizes their articles as not reflecting “a serious way of writing history.” his own “opinions about the history of 1948 haven’t changed at all”, morris asserts. he maintains that “some palestinians were expelled (from lod and ramle, for example), some were ordered or encouraged by their leaders to flee (from haifa, for example) and most fled for fear of the hostilities and apparently in the belief that they would return to their homes after the expected arab victory. “and indeed, beginning in june, the new israeli government adopted a policy of preventing the return of refugees—those same palestinians who fought the yishuv, the prestate jewish community, and tried to destroy it.” morris contends, “in 1947–1948 there was no a priori intention to expel the arabs, and during the war there was no policy of expulsion. there are clearly israel-hating ‘historians’ like ilan pappe and walid khalidi, and perhaps also daniel blatman, going by what he has said, who see the haganah’s plan dalet of march 10, 1948, as a master plan for expelling the palestinians. it isn’t.” rather, plan d “was intended to craft strategy and tactics for the haganah to maintain its hold on strategic roads in what was to become the jewish state. it also sought to secure the borders in the run-up to the expected arab invasion following the departure of the british. blatman’s contention that plan dalet ‘discussed the intention of expelling as many arabs as possible from the territory of the future jewish state’ is a malicious falsification. these are the words of a pro-arab propagandist, not of a historian.” furthermore, plan d “explicitly states that the inhabitants of villages that fight the jews should be expelled and the villages destroyed, while neutral or friendly villages should be left untouched (and have forces garrisoned there). “as for arab neighborhoods in mixed cities, the haganah field commanders ordered that the arabs of the outlying neighborhoods be transferred to the arab centers of those cities, like haifa, not expelled from the country.” morris contends that, “if there had been a master plan and a policy of ‘expelling the arabs,’ we would have found indications of this in the various operational orders to the combat units, and in the reports to the command headquarters, like ‘we carried out the expulsion in accordance with the master plan’ or ‘with plan dalet.’ there are no such mentions.” true, “there was an ‘atmosphere of transfer,’” but this was “understandable in light of the circumstances: constant attacks by palestinian militias over four months and the expectation of an impending invasion by the arab armies aimed at annihilating the jewish state to be and perhaps the people as well.” this “necessitated occupation and the expelling of villagers who ambushed, sniped at and killed jews along the borders and the main roads.” moreover, “the vast majority of arabs fled, and the officers of the haganah/idf had no need to face the decision of whether to expel them.” [7] on the night of april 7-8, under the command of abd al-qadir al-husseini, palestinian irregulars counterattacked the haganah occupiers of castel. the palestinians are seen here moving to the counterattack. from walid khalidi, before their diaspora, page 334. ( public domain ) points of agreement while there are a number of points on which morris and his critics heatedly disagree, it’s imperative to begin by highlighting those facts that aren’t in dispute. first and foremost, it’s completely uncontroversial that hundreds of thousands of arabs fled or were expelled from their homes by the zionist forces during the 1948 war—about 700,000, according to morris, by the time it was done. also uncontroversial is the fact that much of this flight and expulsion occurred well before the neighboring arab states sent in their armies following the zionists’ declaration of the existence of the state of israel on may 14, 1948. in his book the birth of the palestinian refugee problem, 1947–1949 , morris estimates the number of arabs made refugees prior to may 14 at somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000. in his book the ethnic cleansing of palestine , israeli historian ilan pappé writes, “there were in fact 350,000 if one adds all of the population from the 200 towns and villages that were destroyed by 15 may 1948.” [8] this is consistent with morris’s remark that the number was “apparently smaller” than 400,000. another uncontroversial fact is that there was a prevailing “atmosphere of transfer” among the zionist leadership—with “transfer” being a euphemism for the forced displacement of arabs from their homes. as morris notes in his book 1948: a history of the first arab-israeli war , “an atmosphere of what would later be called ethnic cleansing prevailed”, and, to be sure, “much of the country had been ‘cleansed’ of arabs” by the end of the war. [9] david ben-gurion issues the zionists’ unilateral declaration of the existence of the state of israel on may 14, 1948, beneath a portrait of theodor herzl ( rudi weissenstein ) indeed, the idea that the arabs would have to go was an assumption inherent in the ideology of political zionism. the austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl, who is considered the father of the movement, outlined the zionist project in a pamphlet titled the jewish state in 1896. [10] a year prior, he had expressed in his diary the need to rid the land of its arab majority: “we shall have to spirit the penniless population across the border, by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our own country. both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.” [11] in 1937, the british peel commission proposed that palestine be partitioned into separate jewish and arab states, but there was a problem: there would remain an estimated 225,000 arabs in the area proposed for the jewish state. “sooner or later there should be a transfer of land and, as far as possible, an exchange of population”, the commission concluded. it proceeded to draw attention to the “instructive precedent” of an agreement between the governments of greece and turkey in the aftermath of the greco-turkish war of 1922 that determined that “greek nationals of the orthodox religion living in turkey should be compulsorily removed to greece, and turkish nationals of the moslem religion living in greece to turkey.” the commission expressed its hope “that the arab and the jewish leaders might show the same high statesmanship as that of the turks and the greeks and make the same bold decision for the sake of peace.” [12] of course, the commission was not unmindful of “the deeply-rooted aversion which all arab peasants have shown in the past to leaving the lands which they have cultivated for many generations. they would, it is believed, strongly object to a compulsory transfer . . . .” [13] obstacle to peace the us role in the israeli-palestinian conflict by jeremy r. hammond order now learn more as morris notes in 1948 , “the fact that the peel commission in 1937 supported the transfer of arabs out of the jewish state-to-be without doubt consolidated the wide acceptance of the idea among the zionist leaders.” [14] “once the peel commission had given the idea its imprimatur, . . . the floodgates were opened. ben-gurion, weizmann, shertok, and others—a virtual consensus—went on record in support of transfer at meetings of the jae [jewish agency executive] at the twentieth zionist congress (in august 1937, in zurich) and in other forums.” [15] chaim weizmann, for example, in january 1941 told the soviet ambassador to london, ivan maiskii, “if half a million arabs could be transferred, two million jews could be put in their place.” [16] the zionist leader who would become israel’s first prime minister, david ben-gurion, after the peel commission had recommended the “compulsory transfer” of arabs, expressed his acceptance of the partition plan as a pragmatic first step toward the ultimate goal of establishing a jewish state over all of the territory of palestine. on october 5, 1937, he wrote to his son (underlined emphasis in original): of course the partition of the country gives me no pleasure. but the country that they are partitioning is not in our actual possession; it is in the possession of the arabs and the english. what is in our actual possession is a small portion, less than what they are proposing for a jewish state. if i were an arab i would have been very indignant. but in this proposed partition we will get more than what we already have, though of course much less than we merit and desire. . . . what we really want is not that the land remain whole and unified. what we want is that the whole and unified land be jewish . a unified eretz israeli [ sic ] would be no source of satisfaction for me—if it were arab. acceptance of “a jewish state on only part of the land”, ben-gurion continued, was “not the end but the beginning.” in time, the jews would settle the rest of the land, “through agreement and understanding with our arab neighbors, or through some other means ” (emphasis added). if the arabs didn’t acquiesce to the establishment of a jewish state in the place of palestine, then the jews would “have to talk to them in a different language” and might be “compelled to use force” to realize their goals. [17] “my approach to the solution of the question of the arabs in the jewish state”, said ben-gurion in june 1938, “is their transfer to arab countries.” the same year, he told the jewish agency executive, “i am for compulsory transfer. i do not see anything immoral in it.” [18] the idea of partitioning palestine was resurrected by the un special committee on palestine (unscop), which had drawn up the plan endorsed by the un general assembly in resolution 181 on november 29, 1947. this plan, too, contained the inherent problem of a sizable population of arabs who would remain within the boundaries of the proposed jewish state. benny morris documents the attitude of the zionist leadership with respect to this dilemma: the zionists feared that the arab minority would prefer, rather than move to the arab state, to accept the citizenship of the jewish state. and “we are interested in less arabs who will be citizens of the jewish state,” said golda myerson (meir), acting head of the jewish agency political department. yitzhak gruenbaum, a member of the jewish agency executive and head of its labor department, thought that arabs who remained in the jewish state but were citizens of the arab state would constitute “a permanent irredenta.” ben-gurion thought that the arabs remaining in the jewish state, whether citizens of the arab or jewish state, would constitute an irredenta—and in the event of war, they would become a “fifth column.” if they are citizens of the arab state, argued ben-gurion, “[we] would be able to expel them,” but if they were citizens of the jewish state, “we will be able only to jail them. and it is better to expel them than jail them.” so it was better not to facilitate their receipt of jewish state citizenship. but ben-gurion feared that they would prefer this citizenship. eli‘ezer kaplan, the jewish agency’s treasurer, added: “our young state will not be able to stand such a large number of strangers in its midst.” [19] in sum, there was a consensus that such a sizable population of arabs within the borders of their desired “jewish state” was unacceptable. the events that followed must be analyzed within the context of this explicit understanding among the zionist leadership that, one way or another, a large number of arabs would have to go. ruins of the former arab village of bayt jibrin, in the west bank west of hebron. ( public domain ) who started the war? one of morris’s main arguments underscoring his denial of ethnic cleansing is that it was the arabs, not the jews, who started the war after having rejected the un partition plan. he points to hostile actions by the arabs between the end of november 1947 and may 1948, but, of course, there were also hostile actions by the jews during this same period. so is there a particular incident morris can point to as having marked the initiation of these hostilities? in fact, in his book 1948 , he does point to a specific event. early in the morning on november 30—the day after resolution 181 was adopted in the un general assembly—an eight-man armed band from jaffa ambushed a jewish bus near kfar syrkin, killing five. half an hour later, the gang attacked a second bus, killing two more. “these were the first dead of the 1948 war”, morris writes. yet morris also acknowledges that these attacks were almost certainly “not ordered or organized by” the arab palestinian leadership. and “the majority view” in the intelligence wing of the haganah—the zionists’ paramilitary organization that later became the israel defense forces (idf)—“was that the attackers were driven primarily by a desire to avenge” a raid by the jewish terrorist group lehi, also known as the stern gang, on an arab family ten days prior. lehi “had selected five males of the shubaki family and executed them in a nearby orange grove” as an act of revenge for the apparently mistaken belief that the shubakis had informed the british authorities about a lehi training session that prompted a british raid on the group in which five jewish youths were killed. [20] so why wasn’t the murder of five arabs by the jewish terrorist organization the initiating act of hostility marking the start of the 1948 war, in morris’s account? clearly, to try to assess responsibility for the war by pinpointing this or that incident of tit-for-tat violence is an exercise in futility. moreover, apart from overlooking the zionists’ own acts of hostility, morris’s claim that the arabs started the war serves to remove the mutual hostilities that broke out in the wake of the general assembly’s adoption of resolution 181 from their larger context—and it is only within that larger context that a proper assessment of which side bore greater responsibility for the war can be made. as in the above example, morris tends to portray jewish violence against arabs as always being preceded by arab violence against jews—even though, as just illustrated, it was equally true that the arab violence had, in turn, been preceded by jewish violence. elsewhere, in contrast to how he characterizes arab violence, morris describes unambiguous war crimes committed by the zionist forces as merely “mistakes”. included among the haganah’s “mistakes” was an attack on december 18, 1947, on the village of khisas. carried out with the approval of yigal allon, the commander of the palmach (an elite unit within the jewish army), zionist forces invaded the village and indiscriminately murdered seven men, a woman, and four children. morris describes this as a “reprisal” for the murder of a jewish cart driver earlier that day, even though, as he superfluously notes, “none of the dead appear to have been involved in the death of the cart driver.” [21] another of the haganah’s “mistakes” occurred on the night of january 5, 1948, when zionist forces entered the west jerusalem neighborhood of katamon and bombed the semiramis hotel, killing twenty-six civilians, including a government official from spain. “the explosion triggered the start of a ‘panic exodus’ from the prosperous arab neighborhood.” the british were furious, and ben-gurion subsequently removed the officer responsible from command. [22] palestinian refugees from the 1948 war (source: hanini.org / cc by 3.0 ) “but generally”, morris continues, “haganah retaliatory strikes during december 1947–march 1948 were accurately directed, either against perpetrators or against their home bases”—meaning the arab villages where they lived. thus, according to morris’s own criteria, when the haganah attacked an arab village that happened to be home to one or more combatants and proceeded to go about “accurately” killing innocent civilians and destroying their homes, this was by no means a “mistake”. instructively, morris quotes a document from the intelligence wing of the haganah on the consequences of what he describes as the “jewish reprisals” that occurred during those months: “the main effect of these operations was on the arab civilian population ” (emphasis added), the haganah noted, including “the destruction of their houses” and psychological trauma. among other consequences, “the jewish attacks forced the arabs to tie down great forces in protecting themselves ” (emphasis added). [23] thus morris’s characterization of arabs as the aggressors and the haganah as being on the defensive throughout this period is contradicted by his own account, citing primary source evidence that precisely the opposite was true. indeed, morris goes into considerable detail documenting how, in his own summation, “the yishuv had organized for war. the arabs hadn’t.” [24] morris’s characterization of the arabs as always being the aggressors and the jews as being on the defensive, despite occasional “mistakes” such as those just noted, extends well prior to the onset of the 1948 war. while lehi’s murder of five members of the shubaki family on november 20 seems to fit morris’s criteria for a “mistake”, he could, in turn, also point to arab attacks on jews that had occurred well prior to that incident. he writes, for example, that in the spring and summer of 1939 the irgun zvai leumi, “which had been formed by activist breakaways from the haganah, subjected the arab towns to an unnerving campaign of retaliatory terrorism, with special haganah units adding to the bloodshed through selective reprisals ” (emphasis added). [25] once again we see that, while morris doesn’t try to justify such acts of terrorism, he does characterize them as only occurring in retaliation for earlier acts of aggression by arabs. indeed, morris could go back a decade prior, within this exercise of trying to pinpoint responsibility for the initiation of such tit-for-tat violence, and point to the 1929 massacre of jews in hebron; or, further, to may 1921, when arab mobs murdered jews in jaffa; or further still, to april 1920, when arab rioters killed five jews in jerusalem. there is no dispute that these earlier incidences of violence were initiated by arabs. but the question remains of why they occurred. did these murderous attacks reflect an inherent hatred of jews among the arab population? or is there some other context that the debate morris has had with his critics is still missing? the rejection of palestinian self-determination the struggle for palestine and the roots of the arab-israeli conflict by jeremy r. hammond an overview of the crucial period from the rise of the zionist movement until the creation of the state of israel. order now learn more those were questions the british occupiers asked themselves and conducted inquiries to try to answer. the inquiry into the outbreak of violence in 1921, the haycraft commission, determined that “there is no inherent anti-semitism in the country, racial or religious. we are credibly assured by educated arabs that they would welcome the arrival of well-to-do and able jews who could help to develop the country to their advantage of all sections of the community.” [26] the outbreaks, rather, reflected the growing apprehension and resentment among the arabs toward the zionist project to reconstitute palestine into a “jewish state”—and in so doing to displace or otherwise disenfranchise and the land’s majority arab population. nor were the arabs’ fears unfounded; indeed, the zionists were quite open about their intentions. when the acting chairman of the zionist commission was interviewed, for example, “he was perfectly frank in expressing his view of the zionist ideal. . . . in his opinion there can only be one national home in palestine, and that a jewish one, and no equality in the partnership between jews and arabs, but a jewish predominance as soon as the numbers of that race are sufficiently increased.” [27] the shaw commission inquiring into the cause of the 1929 violence arrived at the same conclusion and further observed: in less than ten years three serious attacks have been made by arabs on jews. for eighty years before the first of these attacks there is no recorded instance of any similar incidents. it is obvious then that the relations between the two races during the past decade must have differed in some material respect from those which previously obtained. of this we found ample evidence. the reports of the military court and of the local commission which, in 1920 and in 1921 respectively, enquired into the disturbances of those years, drew attention to the change in the attitude of the arab population towards the jews in palestine. this was borne out by the evidence tendered during our enquiry when representatives of all parties told us that before the war the jews and arabs lived side by side if not in amity, at least with tolerance, a quality which to-day is almost unknown in palestine. [28] morris likewise notes in 1948 that the attacks were chiefly motivated by “the fear and antagonism toward the zionist enterprise”: “the bouts of violence of 1920, 1921, and 1929 were a prelude to the far wider, protracted eruption of 1936–1939, the (palestine) arab revolt. again, zionist immigration and settlement—and the prospect of the judaization of the country and possibly genuine fears of ultimate displacement—underlay the outbreak.” [29] as jewish agency chairman david ben-gurion wrote to the director of the agency’s political department, moshe shertok, in 1937, “what arab cannot do his math and understand that immigration at the rate of 60,000 a year means a jewish state in all of palestine?” [30] as morris also documents, ben-gurion understood the arab perspective perfectly well. with respect to the 1936–1939 arab revolt, ben-gurion told his colleagues, “we must see the situation for what it is. on the security front, we are those attacked and who are on the defensive. but in the political field we are the attackers and the arabs are those defending themselves. they are living in the country and own the land, the village. we live in the diaspora and want only to immigrate [to palestine] and gain possession of [ lirkosh ] the land from them.” [31] ben-gurion told zionist leader nahum goldmann years later, after the establishment of israel, “why should the arabs make peace? if i was an arab leader i would never make terms with israel. that is natural: we have taken their country. sure, god promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? our god is not theirs. we come from israel, it’s true, but two thousand years ago, and what is that to them? there has been anti-semitism, the nazis, hitler, auschwitz, but was that their fault? they only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. why should they accept that?” [32] another aspect of morris’s assessment that warrants emphasis is how he takes for granted that the un partition plan was an equitable solution and that it was unreasonable of the arabs to have rejected it. while accusing his critics of “pro-arab propaganda”, this assumption reveals his own demonstrable prejudice toward the palestinians. in truth, the un partition plan was preposterously inequitable. here, too, some additional historical background helps illuminate the context in which resolution 181 was adopted, as well as the questions of why the 1948 war started and who bore greater responsibility for it. lord arthur balfour in tel aviv, c. 1925 (from the g. eric and edith matson photograph collection at the library of congress ) the zionist mandate for palestine during the first world war, the british came to occupy the territory of palestine, having conquered it from the defeated ottoman empire. on november 2, 1917, british foreign secretary lord arthur james balfour sent a letter to financier and representative of the zionist movement lord lionel walter rothschild that contained a declaration approved by the british cabinet. the declaration read: his majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country. this statement, which became known as “the balfour declaration”, was cited by the zionist leadership as having legitimized their aspirations, which had been reiterated by lord rothschild just a few months prior, on july 18, in a memorandum that expressed “the principle that palestine should be re-constituted as the national home for the jewish people.” any opinion the arabs might have had about their homeland being so “re-constituted” was of no consideration. [33] the purpose of the declaration was to secure jewish support for the war effort. as prime minister lloyd george noted, it was for “propaganda reasons”. the aforementioned 1937 british commission headed up by lord william peel explained that “it was believed that jewish sympathy or the reverse would make a substantial difference one way or the other to the allied cause. in particular jewish sympathy would confirm the support of american jewry . . . .” the zionist leaders promised that, “if the allies committed themselves to giving facilities for the establishment of a national home for the jews in palestine, they would do their best to rally jewish sentiment and support throughout the world to the allied cause.” [34] “the fact that the balfour the balfour declaration was issued in 1917 in order to enlist jewish support for the allies and the fact that this support was forthcoming”, the peel commission further remarked, “are not sufficiently appreciated in palestine.” [35] the wording “national home for the jewish people” was chosen because it was not politically feasible for the british government to “commit itself to the establishment of a jewish state” in the place of palestine; the best it could do was to facilitate immigration and deny self-determination to the people of palestine—the only one of the formerly mandated territories whose independence was not recognized—until such time as the jews had managed to establish a majority. [36] the problem with this plan was that the arabs recognized that the goal of the zionist project “would ultimately tend to their political and economic subjection. the arabs were aware that this prospect was definitely envisaged not only by the zionists of the ‘extremist’ kind, . . . but also by more responsible representatives of zionism, such as dr. eder, the acting chairman of the zionist commission . . . .” [37] the peel commission further acknowledged that “the forcible conversion of palestine into a jewish state against the will of the arabs . . . would mean that national self-determination had been withheld when the arabs were a majority in palestine and only conceded when the jews were a majority. it would mean that the arabs had been denied the opportunity of standing by themselves: that they had, in fact, after an interval of conflict, been bartered about from turkish sovereignty to jewish sovereignty.” [38] in an effort to allay arab apprehension and garner their support, as well, for the war effort, western governments promised the people of the region their independence. in january 1918, president woodrow wilson outlined his “fourteen points”, promising respect for the right to self-determination and independence for the people living under turkish rule: “the turkish portions of the present ottoman empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.” [39] on november 7, 1918, the british and french governments issued a joint declaration stating that “the object aimed at by france and great britain in prosecuting in the east the war let loose by german ambition is the complete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the turks, and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous populations.” [40] the british were not incognizant of the self-contradictory nature of its promises. in a memorandum to british foreign secretary george curzon on august 11, 1919, lord balfour acknowledged the “flagrant” contradictions of british policy, but dismissed it as a matter of no concern: for in palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country . . . . the four great powers are committed to zionism and zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long tradition, in present needs, in future hopes, and far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 arabs who now inhabit that ancient land. no declaration had been made by the british with regard to the inhabitants of palestine, balfour added, that “they have not always intended to violate”. [41] as the peel commission later noted, “it was never doubted that the experiment”—meaning the zionist project—“would have to be controlled by one of the great powers; and to that end it was agreed . . . that palestine should have its place in the new mandate system . . . .” [42] the league of nations’ mandate for palestine was intended to give the color of law to britain’s occupation and the policies enacted under its administration. it was not only favorable toward their goals, but was effectively written by the zionists themselves. as the peel commission pointed out: on the 3rd february the zionist organisation presented a draft resolution embodying its scheme for the execution of the balfour declaration. on the 27th of february its leaders appeared before the supreme council and explained the scheme. a more detailed plan, dated the 28th of march, was drafted by mr. felix frankfurter, an eminent american zionist. from these and other documents and records it is clear that the zionist project had already in those early days assumed something like the shape of the mandate as we know it. [43] not surprisingly, given the zionists’ role in drafting the mandate, it included the terms of the balfour declaration, charging the british with enacting policies to “secure the establishment of the jewish national home”—including the facilitation of jewish immigration—and requiring the british administration to consult and cooperate with the jewish agency toward that end. it contained no provisions assuring the arab majority that they would have a say in the administration of their homeland by the foreign occupying power and its european colonialist partners. [44] the arab legion attacking the jewish quarter of jerusalem, may 1948 ( john phillips/life magazine ) the expropriation of the land as theodor herzl had envisioned, the mandate facilitated the process of expropriation and removal of the poor arab peasants by the zionists, including by denying them employment. the constitution of the jewish agency for palestine signed in zurich on august 14, 1920, stated: land is to be acquired as jewish property and . . . the title to the lands acquired is to be taken in the name of the jewish national fund [jnf], to the end that the same shall be held as the inalienable property of the jewish people. . . . the agency shall promote agricultural colonization based on jewish labour, and in all works or undertakings carried out or furthered by the agency, it shall be deemed to be a matter of principle that jewish labour shall be employed . . . . [45] a 1930 report by sir john hope simpson for the british government on immigration, land settlement, and development noted that, “actually the result of the purchase of land in palestine by the jewish national fund has been that the land has been extraterritorialised. it ceases to be land from which the arab can gain any advantage either now or at any time in the future. not only can he never hope to lease or to cultivate it, but, by the stringent provisions of the lease of the jewish national fund, he is deprived for ever from employment on that land.” [46] the prejudice underlying the jnf’s policy blinded the zionist leadership to the harm it also caused to jewish landowners. the 1921 british haycraft commission report cited an example: [t]he zionist commission put strong pressure upon a large jewish landowner of richon-le-zion to employ jewish labour in place of the arabs who had been employed on his farm since he was a boy. the farmer, we were told, yielded to this pressure with reluctance, firstly, because the substitution of jewish for arab labour would alienate the arabs, secondly, because the pay demanded by the jewish labourers, and the short hours during which they would consent to work, would make it impossible for him to run his farm at a profit.

[48] had the jewish settlement in palestine proceeded along the lines of the pica colonies, history would undoubtedly have been very different. alas, it was the policies of the jnf that came to characterize the nature of the colonization project. as the hope simpson report noted: at the moment this policy is confined to the zionist colonies, but the general federation of jewish labour is using every effort to ensure that it shall be extended to the colonies of the p.i.c.a., and this with some considerable success. . . . it will be a matter of great regret if the friendly spirt which characterized the relations between the jewish employer in the p.i.c.a. villages and his arab employees . . . were to disappear. unless there is some change of spirit in the policy of the zionist organisation it seems inevitable that the general federation of jewish labour, which dominates that policy, will succeed in extending its principles to all the jewish colonies in palestine. . . . the arab population already regards the transfer of lands to zionist hands with dismay and alarm. these cannot be dismissed as baseless in the light of the zionist policy . . . . [49] another aspect of the zionists’ land purchases was how it disenfranchised arab inhabitants who had theretofore been living on and working the land. this was achieved by exploiting feudalistic ottoman land laws. under the ottoman land code of 1858, the state effectively claimed ownership of the land and individuals were regarded as tenants. subsequently, the law was amended so individuals could register for a title-deed to the land, but landholders often saw no need to do so unless they were interested in selling. moreover, there were incentives not to register, including the desire to avoid granting legitimacy to the ottoman government, to avoid paying registration fees and taxes, and to evade possible military conscription. additionally, land lived on and cultivated by one individual or family was often registered in the name of another, such as local government magnates who registered large plots or even entire villages in their own names. [50] the british shaw commission report of 1929 described another common means by which the rightful owners of the land were legally disenfranchised: under the turkish regime, especially in the latter half of the eighteenth century, persons of the peasant classes in some parts of the ottoman empire, including the territory now known as palestine, found that by admitting the over-lordship of the sultan or of some member of the turkish aristocracy, they could obtain protection against extortion and other material benefits which counterbalanced the tribune demanded by their over-lord as a return for his protection. accordingly many peasant cultivators at that time either willingly entered into an arrangement of this character or, finding that it was imposed upon them, submitted to it. by these means persons of importance and position in the ottoman empire acquired the legal title to large tracts of land which for generations and in some cases for centuries had been in the undisturbed and undisputed occupation of peasants who . . . had undoubtedly a strong moral claim to be allowed to continue in occupation of those lands. [51] much of the land acquired by the jnf was purchased from absentee landlords, with extreme prejudice toward the poor arab inhabitants who by rights were its legitimate owners. [52] according to the shaw commission, no more than 10 percent of purchased land was acquired from peasants, the rest having been “acquired from the owners of large estates most of whom live outside palestine”. [53] in the vale of esdraelon, for instance, “one of the most fertile parts of palestine”, jews purchased 200,000 dunams (more than 49,000 acres) from a wealthy family of christian arabs from beirut (the sursock family). included in the purchase were 22 villages, “the tenants of which, with the exception of a single village, were displaced: 1,746 families or 8,730 people.” [54] as another example, in the wadi el hawareth area, the jnf purchased 30,826 dunams (more than 7,600 acres) and evicted a large proportion its 1,200 arab inhabitants.

( doron / cc by-sa 3.0 ) resolution 181 and the early phases of the 1948 war despite their best efforts, by the end of the mandate, the jewish settlers had managed to acquire only about 7 percent of the land in palestine. arabs owned more land than jews in every single district, including jaffa, which included the largest jewish population center, tel aviv. according to the unscop report, “the arab population, despite the strenuous efforts of jews to acquire land in palestine, at present remains in possession of approximately 85 percent of the land.” a subcommittee report further observed that “the bulk of the land in the arab state, as well as in the proposed jewish state , is owned and possessed by arabs” (emphasis added). furthermore, the jewish population in the area of their proposed state was 498,000, while the number of arabs was 407,000 plus an estimated 105,000 bedouins. “in other words,” the subcommittee report noted, “at the outset, the arabs will have a majority in the proposed jewish state.” unscop nevertheless proposed that the arab state be constituted from about 44 percent of the whole of palestine, while the jews would be awarded about 55 percent for their state, including the best agricultural lands. the committee was not incognizant of how this plan prejudiced the rights of the majority arab population. in fact, in keeping with the prejudice inherent in the mandate, the unscop report explicitly rejected the right of the arab palestinians to self-determination. the “principle of self-determination” was “not applied to palestine,” the report stated, “obviously because of the intention to make possible the creation of the jewish national home there. actually, it may well be said that the jewish national home and the sui generis mandate for palestine run counter to that principle.” [56] given the proper historical context, we can now return to benny morris’s argument that “the palestinians were the ones who started the war when they rejected the un compromise plan and embarked on hostile acts”. this argument assumes that the arabs’ rejection of the plan was somehow unreasonable. it was not . morris’s argument also assumes that resolution 181 somehow lent legitimacy to the zionists’ goal of establishing a “jewish state” in palestine within the area proposed under unscop’s plan. it did not . while it is a popular myth that the un created israel, the partition plan was actually never implemented. resolution 181 merely recommended that palestine be partitioned and referred the matter to the security council, where it died . needless to say, neither the general assembly nor the security council had any authority to partition palestine against the will of the majority of its inhabitants. although resolution 181 was cited in israel’s founding document as having granted legitimacy to the establishment of the “jewish state”, in truth, the resolution neither partitioned palestine nor conferred any legal authority to the zionists for their unilateral declaration of the existence of the state of israel on may 14, 1948. [57] when morris says that the arabs states had declared their intent “to attack the jewish state when the british left”, what he really means, therefore, is that they declared their intent to take up arms to prevent the zionists from unilaterally declaring for themselves sovereignty over lands they had no rights to and politically disenfranchising the majority population of palestine. morris employs this same rhetorical device—a mainstay of zionist propaganda—in his book 1948 to suggest that it was the arabs who were the aggressors, while the jews were simply defending themselves. for example, he emphasizes that “most of the fighting between november 1947 and mid-may 1948 occurred in the areas earmarked for jewish statehood”—thus implying that most of the fighting occurred on land rightfully belonging to the jews. however, the fact that most of the violence occurred within this area is completely irrelevant and tells us nothing about which side was guilty of aggression. after all, arabs owned more land than jews and much of this fighting took place in arab villages and towns located within that same “earmarked” territory. it is largely on the basis of his assumption that the land proposed for the jewish state under the partition plan was indeed rightfully the jews’ that he can sustain his narrative that, “from the end of november 1947 until the end of march 1948, the arabs held the initiative and the haganah was on the strategic defensive.” [58] “going into the civil war, haganah policy was purely defensive”, morris repeats—although he grants that “the mainstream zionist leaders, from the first, began to think of expanding the jewish state beyond the 29 november partition resolution borders”; and its “defensive policy” during the early months of the war “was dictated in part by a lack of means” as it “was not yet ready for large-scale offensive operations”. [59] but the arabs initiated the violence, in morris’s account, and the haganah acted in self-defense while “occasionally retaliating against arab traffic, villages, and urban neighborhoods.” [60] ilan pappé sheds some additional light on how the haganah’s “defensive” operations were undertaken: the first step was a well-orchestrated campaign of threats. special units of the hagana would enter villages looking for ‘infiltrators’ (read ‘arab volunteers’) and distribute leaflets warning the local people against cooperating with the arab liberation army. any resistance to such an incursion usually ended with the jewish troops firing at random and killing several villagers. the hagana called these incursions ‘violent reconnaissance’ ( hasiyur ha-alim ). . . . in essence the idea was to enter a defenceless village close to midnight, stay there for a few hours, shoot at anyone who dared leave his or her house, and then depart. [61] for example, on december 18, 1947, the haganah attacked the village of khisas at night, randomly blowing up houses with the occupants sleeping inside, killing fifteen, including five children. with a new york times reporter having closely followed the events, ben-gurion issued a public apology and claimed the attack had been unauthorized; but “a few months later, in april, he included it in a list of successful operations.” [62] “much of the fighting in the first months of the war”, writes morris, “took place in and on the edges of the main towns—jerusalem, tel aviv–jaffa, and haifa. most of the violence was initiated by the arabs. arab snipers continuously fired at jewish houses, pedestrians, and traffic and planted bombs and mines along urban and rural paths and roads.” he describes “several days of sniping and haganah responses in kind”—a typical example of how he characterizes the haganah’s violence as occurring in self-defense or as retaliation for earlier arab attacks he identifies as having initiated any given round of fighting. [63] pappé again offers some additional illumination that once again calls into question morris’s assertion that it was the arabs who were mostly responsible for initiating the violence. with respect to haifa, pappé writes: from the morning after the un partition resolution was adopted, the 75,000 palestinians in the city were subjected to a campaign of terror jointly instigated by the irgun and the hagana. as they had only arrived in recent decades, the jewish settlers had built their houses higher up the mountain. thus, they lived topographically above the arab neighbourhoods and could easily shell and snipe at them. they had started doing this frequently since early december. they used other methods of intimidation as well: the jewish troops rolled barrels full of explosives, and huge steel balls, down into the arab residential areas, and poured oil mixed with fuel down the roads, which they then ignited. the moment panic-stricken palestinian residents came running out of their homes to try to extinguish these rivers of fire, they were sprayed with machine-gun fire. in areas where the two communities still interacted, the hagana brought cars to palestinian garages to be repaired, loaded with explosives and detonating devices, and so wreaked death and chaos. a special unit of the hagana, hashahar (‘dawn’), made up of mistarvim —literally hebrew for ‘becoming arab’, that is jews who disguised themselves as palestinians—was behind this kind of assault. the mastermind of these operations was someone called dani agmon, who headed the ‘dawn’ units. on its website, the official historian of the palmach puts it as follows: ‘the palestinians [in haifa] were from december onwards under siege and intimidation.’ but worse was to come. [64] haifa before the ethnic cleansing (source: palestineremembered.com ) plan d morris’s debate with his critics centers largely around “plan d”, for “dalet”, the fourth letter of the hebrew alphabet. in contrast to what he describes as the zionists’ “defensive” stage of the war, plan d marked, by his own account, the beginning of their “war of conquest”. [65] morris is correct that plan d did not explicitly call for “expelling as many arabs as possible from the territory of the future jewish state”, as blatman suggests. but neither did it order that “neutral or friendly villages should be left untouched”, as morris contends. under plan d, brigade commanders were to use their own discretion in mounting operations against “enemy population centers”—meaning arab towns and villages—by choosing between the following options: —destruction of villages (setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines in the debris), especially those population centers which are difficult to control continuously. —mounting combing and control operations according to the following guidelines: encirclement of the village and conducting a search inside it. in the event of resistance, the armed force must be wiped out and the population must be expelled outside the borders of the state. [66] thus, while plan d allowed for arab inhabitants to remain as long as they did not resist the takeover of their villages by the zionist forces, it did not order haganah commanders to permit them to stay under such circumstances—as morris falsely suggests in the second of his responses in haaretz . nor is morris incognizant of the critical distinction. in 1948 , he explicitly notes that “brigade commanders were given the option ” of destroying arab villages (emphasis added)—which would obviously necessitate expelling their inhabitants—regardless of whether any of the villagers offered any resistance. “the commanders were given discretion whether to evict the inhabitants of villages and urban neighborhoods sitting on vital access roads”, morris writes (emphasis added). “the plan gave the brigades carte blanche to conquer the arab villages and, in effect, to decide on each village’s fate (emphasis added)—destruction and expulsion or occupation. the plan explicitly called for the destruction of resisting arab villages and the expulsion of their inhabitants.” [67] as ilan pappé expounds, “villages were to be expelled in their entirety either because they were located in strategic spots or because they were expected to put up some sort of resistance. these orders were issued when it was clear that occupation would always provoke some resistance and that therefore no village would be immune, either because of its location or because it would not allow itself to be occupied.” [68] by these means, by the time the war ended, the zionist forces had expelled the inhabitants of and destroyed 531 villages and emptied eleven urban neighborhoods of their arab residents. [69] pappé further notes how the facts on the ground at the time challenge morris’s characterization of the zionist’s operations as having been “defensive” prior to the implementation of plan d: the reality of the situation could not have been more different: the overall military, political and economic balance between the two communities was such that not only were the majority of jews in no danger at all, but in addition, between the beginning of december 1947 and the end of march 1948, their army had been able to complete the first stage of the cleansing of palestine, even before the master plan had been put into effect. if there were a turning point in april, it was the shift from sporadic attacks and counter-attacks on the palestinian civilian population towards the systematic mega-operation of ethnic cleansing that now followed. [70] in haaretz , morris adds that in the larger urban areas with mixed populations, under plan d, the orders were for the arabs “to be transferred to the arab centers of those cities, like haifa, not expelled from the country.” morris also writes that the zionists “left arabs in place in haifa”, and he cites it as an example of a place where arabs “were ordered or encouraged by their leaders to flee”—as opposed to them being expelled by the zionist forces. but the details morris provides in 1948 of what happened in haifa tell an altogether different story. by the end of march 1948, most of the wealthy and middle-class families had fled haifa. far from ordering this evacuation, the arab leadership had blasted those who fled as “cowards” and tried to prevent them from leaving. [71] among the reasons for the flight were terrorist attacks by the irgun that had sowed panic in haifa and other cities. on the morning of december 30, 1947, for example, the irgun threw “three bombs from a passing van into a crowd of casual arab laborers at a bus stop outside the haifa oil refinery, killing eleven and wounding dozens.” [72] (ilan pappé notes that “throwing bombs into arab crowds was the specialty of the irgun, who had already done so before 1947.” [73] and as morris points out, arab militias took note of the methods of the irgun and lehi and eventually started copying them: “the arabs had noted the devastating effects of a few well-placed jewish bombs in jerusalem, jaffa, and haifa . . . .” [74] ) arab laborers inside the plant responded by turning against their jewish coworkers, killing thirty-nine and wounding fifty (several arab employees did try to protect their jewish co-workers). [75] the haganah retaliated by targeted a nearby village that was home to many of the refinery workers. the orders were to spare the women and children, but to kill the men. “the raiders moved from house to house, pulling out men and executing them. sometimes they threw grenades into houses and sprayed the interiors with automatic fire. there were several dozen dead, including some women and children.” ben-gurion defended the attack by saying it was “impossible” to “discriminate” under the circumstances. “we’re at war. . . . there is an injustice in this, but otherwise we will not be able to hold out.” [76] marking “the start of the implementation of plan d”, writes morris, was operation nahshon in april 1948. [77] by this time, tens of thousands of haifa’s seventy thousand arabs had already fled. [78] the haganah had been planning an operation in haifa since mid-month, and when the british withdrew their troops from positions between arab and jewish neighborhoods on april 21, it provided the haganah with the opportunity to put it into effect. [79] the haganah fired mortars indiscriminately into the lower city, and by noon “smoke rose above gutted buildings and mangled bodies littered the streets and alleyways.” the mortar and machine gun fire “precipitated mass flight toward the british-held port area”, where arab civilians trampled each other to get to boats, many of which were capsized in the mad rush. [80] the british high commissioner, sir alan cunningham, described the haganah’s tactics: “recent jewish military successes (if indeed operations based on the mortaring of terrified women and children can be classed as such) have aroused extravagant reactions in the jewish press and among the jews themselves a spirit of arrogance which blinds them to future difficulties. . . . jewish broadcasts both in content and in manner of delivery, are remarkably like those of nazi germany.” [81] an elderly man and a girl, refugees of the 1948 war (source: hanini.org / cc by 3.0 ) it was under these circumstances that the local arab leaders sought to negotiate a truce, and in a british-mediated meeting in the afternoon on april 22, the jewish forces proposed a surrender agreement that “assured the arab population a future ‘as equal and free citizens of haifa.’” [82] but the arab notables, after taking some time to consult before reconvening, informed that they were in no position to sign the truce since they had no control over the arab combatants in haifa and that the population was intent on evacuating. jewish and british officials at the meeting tried to persuade them to sign the agreement, to no avail. in the days that followed, nearly all of haifa’s remaining inhabitants fled, with only about 5,000 remaining. while in his haaretz article, morris attributed this flight solely to orders from the arab leadership to leave the city, in 1948 , he notes that other factors included psychological trauma from the violence—especially the haganah’s mortaring of the lower city—and despair at the thought of living now as a minority under a people who had just inflicted that collective punishment upon them. furthermore, “the jewish authorities almost immediately grasped that a city without a large (and actively or potentially hostile) arab minority would be better for the emergent jewish state, militarily and politically. moreover, in the days after 22 april, haganah units systematically swept the conquered neighborhoods for arms and irregulars; they often handled the population roughly; families were evicted temporarily from their homes; young males were arrested, some beaten. the haganah troops broke into arab shops and storage facilities and confiscated cars and food stocks. looting was rife.” [83] this, then, is the situation morris is describing when he disingenuously writes in haaretz that the zionist forces “left arabs in place in haifa” and that arabs fled haifa because they were “ordered or encouraged by their leaders”. we can also compare morris’s account of how the village of lifta came to be emptied of its arab inhabitants with ilan pappé’s. 1984 contains only one mention of lifta, a single sentence in which morris characterizes it as another example of how arabs fled upon the orders of their leadership: “for example, already on 3–4 december 1947 the inhabitants of lifta, a village on the western edge of jerusalem, were ordered to send away their women and children (partly in order to make room for incoming militiamen).” [84] pappé tells a remarkably different story, describing lifta, with its population of 2,500, as “one of the very first to be ethnically cleansed”: social life in lifta revolved around a small shipping centre, which included a club and two coffee houses. it attracted jerusalemites as well, as no doubt it would today were it still there. one of the coffee houses was the target of the hagana when it attacked on 28 december 1947. armed with machine guns the jews sprayed the coffee house, while members of the stern gang stopped a bus nearby and began firing into it randomly. this was the first stern gang operation in rural palestine; prior to the attack, the gang had issued pamphlets to its activists: ‘destroy arab neighbourhoods and punish arab villages.’ the involvement of the stern gang in the attack on lifta may have been outside the overall scheme of the hagana in jerusalem, according to the consultancy [i.e., ben-gurion and his close advisors], but once it had occurred it was incorporated into the plan. in a pattern that would repeat itself, creating faits accomplis became part of the overall strategy. the hagana high command at first condemned the stern gang attack at the end of december, but when they realized that the assault had caused the villagers to flee, they ordered another operation against the same village on 11 january in order to complete the expulsion. the hagana blew up most of the houses in the village and drove out all the people who were still there. [85] the lesson learned was also applied in jerusalem. on february 7, 1948, ben-gurion went to see lifta for himself and that evening reported to a council of the mapai party in jerusalem: when i come now to jerusalem, i feel i am in a jewish ( ivrit ) city. this is a feeling i only had in tel-aviv or in an agricultural farm. it is true that not all of jerusalem is jewish, but it has in it already a huge jewish bloc: when you enter the city through lifta and romema, through mahaneh yehuda, king george street and mea shearim—there are no arabs. one hundred percent jews. ever since jerusalem was destroyed by the romans—the city was not as jewish as it is now. in many arab neighbourhoods in the west you do not see even one arab. i do not suppose it will change. and what happened in jerusalem and in haifa—can happen in large parts of the country. if we persist it is quite possible that in the next six or eight months there will be considerable changes in the country, very considerable, and to our advantage. there will certainly be considerable changes in the demographic composition of the country. [86] note that all of this happened well before explicit orders were given to destroy villages and expel their inhabitants if anyone resisted occupation by the zionist forces. from mid-march onward, in morris’s own words, “in line with plan d, arab villages were henceforward to be leveled to prevent their reinvestment by arab forces; the implication was that their inhabitants were to be expelled and prevented from returning.” [87] the haganah “embarked on a campaign of clearing areas of arab inhabitants and militia forces and conquering and leveling villages”. [88] plan d implemented a “new policy, of permanently occupying and/or razing villages and of clearing whole areas of arabs”. [89] morris’s contention that what happened wasn’t ethnic cleansing because most palestinians fled, as opposed to being expelled by the zionist forces, becomes a moot distinction in light of how, for example, a massacre that occurred in the arab village of deir yassin in april was “amplified through radio broadcasts . . . to encourage a mass arab exodus from the jewish state-to-be.” [90] david ben-gurion (center) with yitzhak rabin and yigal allon during the 1948 war ( israel defense forces / cc by-nc 2.0 ) in the galilee, “the arab inhabitants of the towns of beit shean (beisan) and safad had to be ‘harassed’ into flight”, according to a planned series of operations conceived in april (“in line with plan d”, morris notes). in charge of these operations was the commander of the palmach, yigal allon. [91] on may 1, two villages north of safad were captured. several dozen male prisoners were executed, and the palmach “proceeded to blow up the two villages as safad’s arabs looked on. the bulk of the third battalion then moved into the town’s jewish quarter and mortared the arab quarters”, prompting many of safad’s arab inhabitants to flee. [92] after five days, the arabs sought a truce, which allon rejected. even some of the local jews “sought to negotiate a surrender and demanded that the haganah leave town. but the haganah commanders were unbending” and continued pounding safad with mortars and its arsenal of 3-inch davidka munitions. the first of the davidka bombs, according to arab sources cited by a haganah intelligence document, killed 13 arabs, mostly children, which triggered a panic and further flight. this, of course, was precisely what was “intended by the palmah commanders when unleashing the mortars against the arab neighborhoods”—which, “literally overnight, turned into a ‘ghost town’”. in the weeks that followed, “the few remaining arabs, most of them old and infirm or christians, were expelled to lebanon or transferred to haifa.” [93] yigal allon summed up the purpose of the palmach’s operations: “we regarded it as imperative to cleanse the interior of the galilee and create jewish territorial continuity in the whole of upper galilee.” he boasted of how he devised a plan to rid the galilee of tens of thousands of arabs without having to actually use force to drive them out. his strategy, which “worked wonderfully”, was to plant rumors that additional reinforcements had arrived “and were about to clean out the villages of the hula [valley]”. local jewish leaders with ties to the area’s villages were tasked with advising their arab neighbors, “as friends, to flee while they could. and the rumor spread throughout the hula that the time had come to flee. the flight encompassed tens of thousands.” [94] morris adds that, “to reinforce this ‘whispering,’ or psychological warfare, campaign, allon’s men distributed fliers, advising those who wished to avoid harm to leave ‘with their women and children.’” [95] morris’s denial that these events he describes constituted ethnic cleansing seems difficult to reconcile with allon’s statement that the goal of the palmach’s operations in the galilee was “to cleanse” the area of its arab inhabitants. in his 2004 interview with ari shavit, morris also noted with respect to the use of the verb “cleanse” to describe what happened throughout palestine, “i know it doesn’t sound nice but that’s the term they used at the time. i adopted it from all the 1948 documents in which i am immersed.” indeed, morris himself used the term repeatedly in his discussion with shavit, in which morris expressed his view that this “cleansing” of palestine was morally justified: ben-gurion was right. if he had not done what he did, a state would not have come into being. that has to be clear. it is impossible to evade it. without uprooting of the palestinians, a jewish state would not have arisen here. . . . there is no justification for acts of rape. there is no justification for acts of massacre. those are war crimes. but in certain conditions, expulsion is not a war crime. i don’t think that the expulsions of 1948 were war crimes. you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs. you have to dirty your hands. . . . there are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing. i know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century, but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide—the annihilation of your people—i prefer ethnic cleansing. . . . that was the situation. that is what zionism faced. a jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 palestinians. therefore it was necessary to uproot them. there was no choice but to expel that population. . . . i feel sympathy for the palestinian people, which truly underwent a hard tragedy. i feel sympathy for the refugees themselves. but if the desire to establish a jewish state here is legitimate, there was no other choice. . . . but i do not identify with ben-gurion. i think he made a serious historical mistake in 1948. even though he understood the demographic issue and the need to establish a jewish state without a large arab minority, he got cold feet during the war. in the end, he faltered. . . . if he was already engaged in expulsion, maybe he should have done a complete job. . . . if the end of the story turns out to be a gloomy one for the jews, it will be because ben-gurion did not complete the transfer in 1948. because he left a large and volatile demographic reserve in the west bank and gaza and within israel itself. . . . the non-completion of the transfer was a mistake. [96] morris’s recent denial that what occurred was ethnic cleansing is also difficult to reconcile with these earlier comments of his. indeed, that would seem quite impossible, which is presumably why

in turn. morris denies that the jewish leadership “carried out a policy of expelling the local arabs”. this denial is untenable. logically, the goal of establishing a demographically “jewish state” would require the “compulsory transfer”—to borrow ben-gurion’s phrase for it, in turn borrowed from the peel commission—of a large number of arabs. ben-gurion and other zionist leaders had explicitly stated their desire to effect this “transfer”, and once war broke out there was a clear tacit understanding between the political leadership and the military commanders toward that end. as morris himself has pointed out, there was an “atmosphere of transfer”, and commanders who carried out such expulsions were not punished. moreover, from mid-march onward, commanders were given explicit instructions for how this “compulsory transfer” was to be carried out. if the expulsion of arab villagers prior to plan d had received the tacit approval of the leadership, the expulsions thereafter received their explicit approval. commanders like yigal allon understood their orders very well: it was “imperative” to “cleanse” their areas of operation of their arab inhabitants. after blatman cited morris to support his assertion that palestine was ethnically cleansed in 1948, morris accused blatman of attributing things to him that he had never claimed. yet morris himself had previously described what happened during the war as “ethnic cleansing”—and expressed his view that ben-gurion’s error was not doing a thorough enough job of it. morris argues that blatman’s assertion “ignores the basic fact that the palestinians were the ones who started the war”. even if we accept his assumptions that the arabs’ rejection of the un partition plan was unreasonable and that they were responsible for starting the war, it does not follow that no ethnic cleansing occurred. in keeping with his comments to ari shavit, what morris really seems to be arguing here is not that it didn’t happen, but that it was justified; it’s not that palestine wasn’t actually ethnically cleansed—clearly, by his own account, it was—just that, in his view, this wasn’t a crime. and while legal scholars may debate whether such actions were prohibited under the laws of war at the time, there isn’t any ambiguity about the fact that they are recognized today as war crimes—and, regardless of what any international treaties had to say about it, just as immoral then as they would be today. moreover, morris’s assumptions that the un partition plan was an equitable solution and that resolution 181 lent legitimacy to the zionists’ unilateral declaration of the existence of the state of israel on may 14, 1948, are both categorically false . he bases his arguments that the jews were acting defensively on the grounds that the arab states had threatened “to attack the jewish state” and then carried out that threat by “invading” israel. but given the illegitimacy of the may 14 declaration and the inherent prejudice of the zionist project toward the majority arab population, this narrative crumbles. to characterize the arabs as the “invaders” while palestine’s arab inhabitants were being systematically expelled or driven into flight and its arab villages literally wiped off the map is simply to flip reality on its head. morris denies that there was ever a decision by the jewish leadership “to ‘expel the arabs’”. he repeats that ben-gurion “never gave [his officers] an order ‘to expel the arabs.’” it might be true that no known documents, including plan d, contained those exact words, but the leadership’s intent was clear. indeed, in the very same sentence he says ben-gurion gave no such order, morris notes that ben-gurion “let his officers understand that it was preferable for as few arabs as possible to remain in the new country”. his implied logic is that without such an explicit order, it wasn’t ethnic cleansing. this is a non sequitur. no explicit order need have been given; it was enough that haganah commanders understood the leaderships’ intention to have “as few arabs as possible”, to quote morris’s own words, in the “jewish state” they were seeking to establish. palestinian refugees fleeing their homes, october 30, 1948 (source: palestineremembered.com ) moreover, plan d did make explicit the operational orders to expel arabs from their villages. morris also suggests that since not all arabs were expelled, therefore it wasn’t ethnic cleansing. but once again his logic is a non sequitur. it doesn’t follow that since there were arabs who were allowed to remain in the territory that became israel that therefore the expulsion of the majority of that territory’s arab inhabitants didn’t constitute ethnic cleansing. morris can opine that ben-gurion didn’t do a thorough enough job of it; but he can’t sustain the suggestion that the lack of thoroughness means it wasn’t ethnic cleansing. the “atmosphere of transfer” is acknowledged by morris; yet he asserts that zionist leaders like ben-gurion and weizmann, who “supported the transfer of arabs” in the 1930s and early ‘40s, later “supported the un decision, whose plan left more than 400,000 arabs in place.” with this comment, he implies that ben-gurion and other leaders changed their minds and decided that a population of 400,000 arabs within the area they desired for their “jewish state” would be just fine. once again, his argument is a non sequitur; their acceptance of the partition plan did not constitute a repudiation of their desire to rid the land of arabs. on the contrary, it was seen as a pragmatic step toward achieving the ultimate goal of establishing a jewish state with “less arabs” (golda meir). indeed, he further acknowledges that the “atmosphere of transfer” still prevailed in april 1948, but, he argues, this “was never translated into official policy—which is why there were officers who expelled arabs and others who didn’t.” but, once again, the fact that some arabs—about 160,000, according to morris—were permitted to remain does not mean that the rest weren’t victims of ethnic cleansing. once again, explicit orders to expel arabs needn’t have existed for us to recognize what occurred as ethnic cleansing; it was enough that a tacit understanding existed between the political leadership and the military commanders, which morris acknowledges was in fact the case—including by pointing out that those commanders who expelled arabs from their villages weren’t punished. moreover, again, the “atmosphere of transfer” was translated into official policy with plan d. on march 24, 1948, morris argues in haaretz , israel galili “ordered all the haganah brigades not to uproot arabs from the territory of the designated jewish state.” in 1948 , he specifies that “galili instructed all haganah units to abide by standing zionist policy, which was to respect the ‘rights, needs and freedom,’ ‘without discrimination,’ of the arabs living in the jewish state areas.” [97] how does morris reconcile this with the explicit orders under plan d to collectively punish the civilian population by expelling them from their homes and destroying their villages? how does he reconcile it with the fact that, by his own account, commanders who expelled arabs and destroyed villages weren’t punished for defying what morris characterizes as a direct order? instructively, he makes no attempt to. but he does note that “things did change in early april”, meaning that this ostensible order to respect the rights of palestinian civilians was rescinded. as he notes in 1948 , the policy outlined in april was “generally, to evict the arabs living in the brigade’s area.” [98] so how does morris, in light of this admission, maintain that “there was no overall expulsion policy”? he notes that “here they expelled people, there they didn’t, and for the most part the arabs simply fled.” but, again, neither the fact that some arabs were allowed to remain nor that many fled out of fear is inconsistent with the recognition of what happened as ethnic cleansing. finally, morris acknowledges that the zionist leadership as a matter of policy prevented the palestinian refugees from returning to their homes. indeed, this was made largely impossible by the complete destruction of their villages. he makes no effort to reconcile this policy with his denial that ethnic cleansing occurred. instead, he opines that this policy was “logical and just”. we see once again, thus, that morris isn’t so much arguing that there was no ethnic cleansing as he is that the ethnic cleansing was justified. he is attempting to argue that the ethnic cleansing that did occur—which he has explicitly acknowledged did occur, and which he documents extensively in his own writings—was not a crime. benny morris is entitled to his opinions. but to deny that the “jewish state” of israel was established by ethnically cleansing hundreds of thousands of arabs from their homes in palestine is simply a display of the very intellectual dishonesty he accuses his critics of. the standard he applies is telling: he defends the ethnic cleansing on the grounds that all of the arabs who were made refugees by the war and whom israel refused to allow to return “had tried to destroy the state in the making.” inasmuch as their very inhabitancy in the land the zionist leadership desired for their “jewish state” stood in the way of that project, he has a point. their very existence in the land constituted a destruction of the zionists’ ideal. hence they had to go. in morris’s own words, “a jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 palestinians. therefore it was necessary to uproot them.” beyond that, morris’s hypocrisy is glaring. he knows perfectly well that most of those expelled were civilians who had taken no part in hostilities. hence what he is really saying here is that it was “logical and just” for the civilian arab population to have been collectively punished for the crime some among them committed of putting up resistance to the zionists’ operations to seize control of the territory they wanted for their “jewish state”—precisely the collective punishment that haganah commanders were ordered to carry out under plan d, the blueprint, by morris’s own account, for the zionists’ “war of conquest”. that benny morris applies such a hypocritical standard should not be too surprising. he is, after all, himself a zionist. as a historian, he has contributed greatly to the literature on the subject, and in so doing, has helped move the discussion forward. by helping us to understand the origins of the conflict, he has empowered us with knowledge that brings clarity on how to achieve a peaceful resolution. it is unfortunate that he’s lately made such a concerted effort to move the discussion backward again. it is in the context of his own deeply held and scarcely concealed prejudice toward the palestinians that his attempts now to deny the ethnic cleansing of palestine must be understood. haganah men patrolling the streets of haifa, april 1948 (life magazine. source: palestineremembered.com ) conclusion was what happened in palestine during the 1948 war “ethnic cleansing”? andrew bell-fialkoff, author of ethnic cleansing , writes that, while the term “defies easy definition”, it can be generally understood as “the expulsion of an ‘undesirable’ population from a given territory due to religious or ethnic discrimination, political, strategic or ideological considerations, or a combination of these.” [99] the us state department, in a 1999 report titled ethnic cleansing in kosovo: an accounting , described “the milosevic regime’s brutal, premeditated, and systematic campaign to expel many kosovar albanians from their homeland.” [100] in a february 2007 judgment, the international court of justice (icj) noted that the term “ethnic cleansing” was used in practice “to mean ‘rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area’”. [101] by any of these definitions, ethnic cleansing is precisely what occurred in palestine during the 1948 war. as ilan pappé writes in the beginning of the ethnic cleansing of palestine , “this book is written with the deep conviction that the ethnic cleansing of palestine must become rooted in our memory and consciousness as a crime against humanity and that it should be excluded from the list of alleged crimes.” [102] indeed, what happened in palestine in 1948 was not an “alleged” ethnic cleansing, as benny morris would have us believe. it is regrettable that he seems to have decided that trying to justify israel’s legitimacy as a “jewish state” is more important than presenting the public with an honest historical representation of how israel came into existence. but far from being “alleged”, the ethnic cleansing of palestine must today be recognized as an uncontroversial historical fact. that this ethnic cleansing occurred is indeed today very well documented—including in benny morris’s own important contributions to the literature on the subject. it is also regrettable that the us mainstream media treat the matter as taboo. this silence must be broken. the means by which the “jewish state” of israel came into existence—via the ethnic cleansing of the arab population of palestine—must be brought out of the darkness and into the light. only by doing so will the prospects for peace between israelis and palestinians have any chance of coming to fruition. jeremy r. hammond jeremy r. hammond is an award-winning independent political analyst and editor and publisher of foreign policy journal . described by barron’s as “a writer of rare skill”, he is the author of obstacle to peace: the us role in the israeli-palestinian conflict (2016), ron paul vs. paul krugman: austrian vs. keynesian economics in the financial crisis (2012), and the rejection of palestinian self-determination: the struggle for palestine and the roots of the israeli-arab conflict (2009). find him on the web at jeremyrhammond.com . obama: hillary clinton pardon could heal divided nation leigh haughnote to president obama: a hillary clinton pardon could heal a divided nation. after all, if it was good enough for richard nixon, it is certainly good enough for clinton. the difference being that tricky dicky was actually guilty of the crimes insinuated against him, whereas the former secretary of state, who was thoroughly investigated and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing twice, continues to be maligned and persecuted by the right-wing establishment, as well as politicos with decades-old grudges w\n"
